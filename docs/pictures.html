<p>For the past 3500 years of the Western world, the effects of media – whether it's speech, writing, printing, photography, radio or television – have been systematically overlooked by social observers. Even in today's revolutionary electronic age, scholars evidence few signs of modifying this traditional stance of ostrichlike disregard.</p>
<h2 id="adream">a dream</h2>
<p>In red hook (near the lobster spot that I am seeing an apartment at today). I ordered a burger quite hurriedly, receiving it soon afterwards. Then went into the apartment and walked around a bit, there were two sections (modern and normalish looking apartments). Someone came in and I sneakily left. People that were ordering food while I was there were at a park looking spot across the street. I went over there to eat. I wandered through the park.</p>
<p>Noticed this old electric plant that was in someway connected to Jerusalem. I saw apartments next to it with machinery all around them (someway connected to the electric plant) - lots of copper tubes and the like all twisted together. The apartments looked old - sorta like some spots I saw in the Jewish area of Williamsburg. Then I saw these birds float to the floor. I looked closely and they were bats - they looked starving and decrepit - machine-like. I googled or the like (information suddenly came to me) and heard that these bats lived here for countless years. There used to be berries from the trees but most of the trees have died (presumably from the electric plant). Now, they are dying left and right - still mechanically dependent on a food source that is no more.</p>

<h2 id="psychedelics">psychedelics</h2>
<p>What is a psychedelic experience? It is associated with a very profound disorganization of electric activity in the brain. The brain becomes very much less organized in the way the brain waves perpetuate and work through the brain. We discovered also that the circuits of the brain, some of the circuits in one of the regions of the brain which we knew from other peoples work to be intimately involved in depression were either down regulated or disrupted by psylosybin. … if you disrupt depression causing circuits then maybe you would limit depression and that’s what we found, that’s what we find. We find that psilocybin produces a profound disruption in a network in the brain that encodes self referential thinking… and that’s the network that depressed people get locked up into thinking negative thoughts about themselves, they ruminate about mistakes they’ve made, they have these repetitive self critical appraisals of themselves. We can disrupt that. After coming out of the trip they can reset their mind</p>

<p>Indeed, the whole problem of volition, so troubling, I think, to modern psychological theory, may have had its difficulties because the words for such phenomena were invented so late.</p>
<h2 id="thatwierdbicameralmindthing">that wierd bicameral mind thing</h2>
<p>Who then were these gods that pushed men about like robots and sang epics through their lips? They were voices whose speech and directions could be as distinctly heard by the Iliadic heroes as voices are heard by certain epileptic and schizophrenic patients, or just as Joan of Arc heard her voices. The gods were organizations of the central nervous system and can be regarded as personae in the sense of poignant consistencies through time, amalgams of parental or admonitory images. The god is a part of the man, and quite consistent with this conception is the fact that the gods never step outside of natural laws. Greek gods cannot create anything out of nothing, unlike the Hebrew god of Genesis.</p>
<p>Another way to say it is that volition came as a voice that was in the nature of a neurological command, in which the command and the action were not separated, in which to hear was to obey.</p>
<p>The function of the gods was chiefly the guiding and planning of action in novel situations. The gods size up problems and organize action according to an ongoing pattern or purpose, resulting in intricate bicameral civilizations, fitting all the disparate parts together, planting times, harvest times, the sorting out of commodities, all the vast putting together of things in a grand design, and the giving of the directions to the neurological man in his verbal analytical sanctuary in the left hemisphere.</p>
<h2 id="thekingstombasthehouseofgodmccluhan">the king's tomb as the house of god (McCluhan)</h2>
<p>The king’s tomb as the god’s house continues through the millennia as a feature of many civilizations, particularly in Egypt. But, more often, the king’s-tomb part of the designation withers away. This occurs as soon as a successor to a king continues to hear the hallucinated voice of his predecessor during his reign, and designates himself as the dead king’s priest or servant, a pattern that is followed throughout Mesopotamia. In place of the tomb is simply a temple. And in place of the corpse is a statue, enjoying even more service and reverence, since it does not decompose.</p>
<h2 id="godrollsthedicemccluhan">god rolls the dice (mccluhan)</h2>
<p>We are so used to the huge variety of games of chance, of throwing dice, roulette wheels, etc., all of them vestiges of this ancient practice of divination by lots, that we find it difficult to really appreciate the significance of this practice historically. It is a help here to realize that there was no concept of chance whatever until very recent times. Therefore, the discovery (how odd to think of it as a discovery!) of deciding an issue by throwing sticks or beans on the ground was an extremely momentous one for the future of mankind. For, because there was no chance, the result had to be caused by the gods whose intentions were being divined.</p>
<h2 id="breathismeasuredbyonesstatemccluhan">breath is measured by one's state (mccluhan)</h2>
<p>Apart from rate, there are also unique changes in the proportion of time occupied by inspiration and by expiration in a single breath cycle. This is best measured by determining the percent of the duration of the breath cycle taken up by inspiration. This is about 16 percent in speech, 23 percent in laughter, 30 percent in attentive mental work, 43 percent when at rest, 60 percent or more in excitement, 71 percent in subjects imagining a wonderful or surprising situation, and 75 percent in sudden fright.3 The point I am trying to make here is that our phrenes or respiratory apparatus can almost be looked at as recording everything we do in quite distinct and distinguishable ways.</p>
<h2 id="abattlecryforwordsmccluhan">a battle cry for words (mccluhan)</h2>
<p>Let no one think these are just word changes. Word changes are concept changes and concept changes are behavioral changes. The entire history of religions and of politics and even of science stands shrill witness to that. Without words like soul, liberty, or truth, the pageant of this human condition would have been filled with different roles, different climaxes. And so with the words we have designated as preconscious hypostases, which by the generating process of metaphor through these few centuries unite into the operator of consciousness.</p>
<h2 id="thewrittenwordasameanstobringgodtoearthmccluhan">the written word as a means to bring god to earth (mccluhan)</h2>
<p>And as visually the bicameral experience recedes into the thick darkness, where thunders and lightnings and driving clouds of dense blackness crowd in on the inaccessible heights of Sinai, we are approaching the greatest teaching of the entire Old Testament, that, as this last of the elohim loses his hallucinatory properties, and is no longer an inaccessible voice in the nervous system of a few semi-bicameral men, and becomes something written upon tablets, he becomes law, something unchanging, approachable by all, something relating to all men equally, king and shepherd, universal and transcendent.</p>
<h2 id="theoldtestamentasastoryofthelossofthebicameralmind">the old testament as a story of the loss of the bicameral mind</h2>
<p>Old Testament, even as it is hedged with great historical problems of accuracy, still remains the richest source for our knowledge of what the transition period was like. It is essentially the story of the loss of the bicameral mind, the slow retreat into silence of the remaining elohim, the confusion and tragic violence which ensue, and the search for them again in vain among its prophets until a substitute is found in right action.</p>
<h2 id="someoddconceptionofjesusmccluhanagain">some odd conception of Jesus (mccluhan again)</h2>
<p>A full discussion here would specify how the attempted reformation of Judaism by Jesus can be construed as a necessarily new religion for conscious men rather than bicameral men. Behavior now must be changed from within the new consciousness rather than from Mosaic laws carving behavior from without. Sin and penance are now within conscious desire and conscious contrition, rather than in the external behaviors of the decalogue and the penances of temple sacrifice and community punishment. The divine kingdom to be regained is psychological not physical. It is metaphorical not literal. It is ‘within’ not in extenso.</p>
<h2 id="placesconducivetogodsmccluhan">places conducive to gods (mccluhan)</h2>
<p>Oracles begin in localities with a specific awesomeness, natural formations of mountain or gorge, of hallucinogenic wind or waves, of symbolic gleamings and vistas, which I suggest are more conducive to occasioning right hemisphere activity than the analytic planes of everyday life. Perhaps we can say that the geography of the bicameral mind in the first part of the first millennium B.C. was shrinking down into sites of awe and beauty where the voices of gods could still be heard.</p>
<h2 id="thepowerofascultptureofgold">the power of a scultpture, of gold</h2>
<p>And if a soul can be imposed on so fragile a thing as flesh to make it live, on a hurtable carcass that has to have vegetable and animal matter stuffed in one end and stenchfully excreted at another, a sense-pocked sinful vessel that the years wrinkle and the winds chafe and diseases cruelly hound, and that can be sliced off in a trice from the soul it holds by the same act that stabs an onion, how much more possible for life, divine life, to be imposed by heaven upon a statue of unbleeding beauty with a faultless and immaculate body of unwrinkling marble or diseaseless gold!</p>
<h2 id="poetryasawaytocommunicatewithgods">poetry as a way to communicate with god's</h2>
<p>Poetry, once started in mankind, needs not the same means for its production. It began as the divine speech of the bicameral mind. And even today, through its infinite mimeses, great poetry to the listener, however it is made, still retains that quality of the wholly other, of a diction and a message, a consolation and an inspiration, that was once our relationship to gods.</p>
<h2 id="whatonebelievesonebecomes">what one believes one becomes</h2>
<p>In the middle of the century, phrenology, the mistaken idea that conformations of the skull indicate mental faculties, became so popular that it actually engulfed hypnosis for a time. Pressure on the scalp over a phrenological area during hypnosis caused the subject to express the faculty controlled by that area (yes, this actually happened), a phenomenon never seen before or since. When the scalp area over the part of the brain supposedly responsible for “veneration” was pressed, the hypnotized subject sunk to his knees in prayer! This was so because it was believed to be so.</p>
<h2 id="remindsmeofdavid">reminds me of David</h2>
<p>Often the paranoid, after a lengthy period of difficulties in getting on with people, may begin the schizophrenic aspect of his illness with an hallucinated religious experience in which an angel, Christ, or God speaks to the patient bicamerally, showing him some new way. He becomes convinced therefore of his own special relationship to the powers of the universe, and the pathological self-reference of all the occurrences around him then becomes elaborated into delusional ideas which may be pursued for years without the patient’s being able to discuss it.</p>
<h2 id="manssearchforthemeaningofitallbicameralthingabitmuch">mans search for the meaning of it all (bicameral thing a bit much)</h2>
<p>But over and behind these and other causes of science has been something more universal, something in this age of specialization often unspoken. It is something about understanding the totality of existence, the essential defining reality of things, the entire universe and man’s place in it. It is a groping among stars for final answers, a wandering the infinitesimal for the infinitely general, a deeper and deeper pilgrimage into the unknown. It is a direction whose far beginning in the mists of history can be distantly seen in the search for lost directives in the breakdown of the bicameral mind.</p>

<h2 id="ahhhhh">ahhhhh</h2>
<p>The decay of religious collective cognitive imperatives under the pressures of rationalist science, provoking, as it does, revision after revision of traditional theological concepts, cannot sustain the metaphoric meaning behind ritual. Rituals are behavioral metaphors, belief acted, divination foretold, exopsychic thinking. Rituals are mnemonic devices for the great narratizations at the heart of church life. And when they are emptied out into cults of spontaneity and drained of their high seriousness, when they are acted unfelt and reasoned at with irresponsible objectivity, the center is gone and the widening gyres begin. The result in this age of communications has been worldwide: liturgy loosened into the casual, awe softening in relevance, and the washing out of that identity-giving historical definition that told man what he was and what he should be.</p>
<h2 id="sciencehasthesamegoalasalltherest">science has the same goal as all the rest</h2>
<p>Science then, for all its pomp of factness, is not unlike some of the more easily disparaged outbreaks of pseudoreligions. In this period of transition from its religious basis, science often shares with the celestial maps of astrology, or a hundred other irrationalisms, the same nostalgia for the Final Answer, the One Truth, the Single Cause. In the frustrations and sweat of laboratories, it feels the same temptations to swarm into sects, even as did the Khabiru refugees, and set out here and there through the dry Sinais of parched fact for some rich and brave significance flowing with truth and exaltation.</p>
