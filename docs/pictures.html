<h2 id="adream">a dream</h2>
<p>In red hook (near the lobster spot that I am seeing an apartment at today). I ordered a burger quite hurriedly, receiving it soon afterwards. Then went into the apartment and walked around a bit, there were two sections (modern and normalish looking apartments). Someone came in and I sneakily left. People that were ordering food while I was there were at a park looking spot across the street. I went over there to eat. I wandered through the park.</p>
<p>Noticed this old electric plant that was in someway connected to Jerusalem. I saw apartments next to it with machinery all around them (someway connected to the electric plant) - lots of copper tubes and the like all twisted together. The apartments looked old - sorta like some spots I saw in the Jewish area of Williamsburg. Then I saw these birds float to the floor. I looked closely and they were bats - they looked starving and decrepit - machine-like. I googled or the like (information suddenly came to me) and heard that these bats lived here for countless years. There used to be berries from the trees but most of the trees have died (presumably from the electric plant). Now, they are dying left and right - still mechanically dependent on a food source that is no more.</p>

<p>What is a psychedelic experience? It is associated with a very profound disorganization of electric activity in the brain. The brain becomes very much less organized in the way the brain waves perpetuate and work through the brain. We discovered also that the circuits of the brain, some of the circuits in one of the regions of the brain which we knew from other peoples work to be intimately involved in depression were either down regulated or disrupted by psylosybin. … if you disrupt depression causing circuits then maybe you would limit depression and that’s what we found, that’s what we find. We find that psilocybin produces a profound disruption in a network in the brain that encodes self referential thinking… and that’s the network that depressed people get locked up into thinking negative thoughts about themselves, they ruminate about mistakes they’ve made, they have these repetitive self critical appraisals of themselves. We can disrupt that. After coming out of the trip they can reset their mind</p>

<p>Indeed, the whole problem of volition, so troubling, I think, to modern psychological theory, may have had its difficulties because the words for such phenomena were invented so late.</p>
<h2 id="thatwierdbicameralmindthing">that wierd bicameral mind thing</h2>
<p>Who then were these gods that pushed men about like robots and sang epics through their lips? They were voices whose speech and directions could be as distinctly heard by the Iliadic heroes as voices are heard by certain epileptic and schizophrenic patients, or just as Joan of Arc heard her voices. The gods were organizations of the central nervous system and can be regarded as personae in the sense of poignant consistencies through time, amalgams of parental or admonitory images. The god is a part of the man, and quite consistent with this conception is the fact that the gods never step outside of natural laws. Greek gods cannot create anything out of nothing, unlike the Hebrew god of Genesis.</p>
<p>Another way to say it is that volition came as a voice that was in the nature of a neurological command, in which the command and the action were not separated, in which to hear was to obey.</p>
<p>The function of the gods was chiefly the guiding and planning of action in novel situations. The gods size up problems and organize action according to an ongoing pattern or purpose, resulting in intricate bicameral civilizations, fitting all the disparate parts together, planting times, harvest times, the sorting out of commodities, all the vast putting together of things in a grand design, and the giving of the directions to the neurological man in his verbal analytical sanctuary in the left hemisphere.</p>
<h2 id="thekingstombasthehouseofgodmccluhan">the king's tomb as the house of god (McCluhan)</h2>
<p>The king’s tomb as the god’s house continues through the millennia as a feature of many civilizations, particularly in Egypt. But, more often, the king’s-tomb part of the designation withers away. This occurs as soon as a successor to a king continues to hear the hallucinated voice of his predecessor during his reign, and designates himself as the dead king’s priest or servant, a pattern that is followed throughout Mesopotamia. In place of the tomb is simply a temple. And in place of the corpse is a statue, enjoying even more service and reverence, since it does not decompose.</p>
<h2 id="godrollsthedicemccluhan">god rolls the dice (mccluhan)</h2>
<p>We are so used to the huge variety of games of chance, of throwing dice, roulette wheels, etc., all of them vestiges of this ancient practice of divination by lots, that we find it difficult to really appreciate the significance of this practice historically. It is a help here to realize that there was no concept of chance whatever until very recent times. Therefore, the discovery (how odd to think of it as a discovery!) of deciding an issue by throwing sticks or beans on the ground was an extremely momentous one for the future of mankind. For, because there was no chance, the result had to be caused by the gods whose intentions were being divined.</p>
<h2 id="breathismeasuredbyonesstatemccluhan">breath is measured by one's state (mccluhan)</h2>
<p>Apart from rate, there are also unique changes in the proportion of time occupied by inspiration and by expiration in a single breath cycle. This is best measured by determining the percent of the duration of the breath cycle taken up by inspiration. This is about 16 percent in speech, 23 percent in laughter, 30 percent in attentive mental work, 43 percent when at rest, 60 percent or more in excitement, 71 percent in subjects imagining a wonderful or surprising situation, and 75 percent in sudden fright.3 The point I am trying to make here is that our phrenes or respiratory apparatus can almost be looked at as recording everything we do in quite distinct and distinguishable ways.</p>
<h2 id="abattlecryforwordsmccluhan">a battle cry for words (mccluhan)</h2>
<p>Let no one think these are just word changes. Word changes are concept changes and concept changes are behavioral changes.

Without words like soul, liberty, or truth, the pageant of this human condition would have been filled with different roles, different climaxes. And so with the words we have designated as preconscious hypostases, which by the generating process of metaphor through these few centuries unite into the operator of consciousness.</p>

<p>And as visually the bicameral experience recedes into the thick darkness, where thunders and lightnings and driving clouds of dense blackness crowd in on the inaccessible heights of Sinai, we are approaching the greatest teaching of the entire Old Testament, that, as this last of the elohim loses his hallucinatory properties, and is no longer an inaccessible voice in the nervous system of a few semi-bicameral men, and becomes something written upon tablets, he becomes law, something unchanging, approachable by all, something relating to all men equally, king and shepherd, universal and transcendent.</p>
<h2 id="theoldtestamentasastoryofthelossofthebicameralmind">the old testament as a story of the loss of the bicameral mind</h2>
<p>Old Testament, even as it is hedged with great historical problems of accuracy, still remains the richest source for our knowledge of what the transition period was like. It is essentially the story of the loss of the bicameral mind, the slow retreat into silence of the remaining elohim, the confusion and tragic violence which ensue, and the search for them again in vain among its prophets until a substitute is found in right action.</p>
<h2 id="someoddconceptionofjesusmccluhanagain">some odd conception of Jesus (mccluhan again)</h2>
<p>A full discussion here would specify how the attempted reformation of Judaism by Jesus can be construed as a necessarily new religion for conscious men rather than bicameral men. Behavior now must be changed from within the new consciousness rather than from Mosaic laws carving behavior from without. Sin and penance are now within conscious desire and conscious contrition, rather than in the external behaviors of the decalogue and the penances of temple sacrifice and community punishment. The divine kingdom to be regained is psychological not physical. It is metaphorical not literal. It is ‘within’ not in extenso.</p>

<h2 id="poetryasawaytocommunicatewithgods">poetry as a way to communicate with god's</h2>
<p>Poetry, once started in mankind, needs not the same means for its production. It began as the divine speech of the bicameral mind. And even today, through its infinite mimeses, great poetry to the listener, however it is made, still retains that quality of the wholly other, of a diction and a message, a consolation and an inspiration, that was once our relationship to gods.</p>
<h2 id="whatonebelievesonebecomes">what one believes one becomes</h2>
<p>In the middle of the century, phrenology, the mistaken idea that conformations of the skull indicate mental faculties, became so popular that it actually engulfed hypnosis for a time. Pressure on the scalp over a phrenological area during hypnosis caused the subject to express the faculty controlled by that area (yes, this actually happened), a phenomenon never seen before or since. When the scalp area over the part of the brain supposedly responsible for “veneration” was pressed, the hypnotized subject sunk to his knees in prayer! This was so because it was believed to be so.</p>
<h2 id="remindsmeofdavid">reminds me of David</h2>
<p>Often the paranoid, after a lengthy period of difficulties in getting on with people, may begin the schizophrenic aspect of his illness with an hallucinated religious experience in which an angel, Christ, or God speaks to the patient bicamerally, showing him some new way. He becomes convinced therefore of his own special relationship to the powers of the universe, and the pathological self-reference of all the occurrences around him then becomes elaborated into delusional ideas which may be pursued for years without the patient’s being able to discuss it.</p>
<h2 id="manssearchforthemeaningofitallbicameralthingabitmuch">mans search for the meaning of it all (bicameral thing a bit much)</h2>
<p>But over and behind these and other causes of science has been something more universal, something in this age of specialization often unspoken. It is something about understanding the totality of existence, the essential defining reality of things, the entire universe and man’s place in it. It is a groping among stars for final answers, a wandering the infinitesimal for the infinitely general, a deeper and deeper pilgrimage into the unknown. It is a direction whose far beginning in the mists of history can be distantly seen in the search for lost directives in the breakdown of the bicameral mind.</p>

<p>The decay of religious collective cognitive imperatives under the pressures of rationalist science, provoking, as it does, revision after revision of traditional theological concepts, cannot sustain the metaphoric meaning behind ritual. Rituals are behavioral metaphors, belief acted, divination foretold, exopsychic thinking. Rituals are mnemonic devices for the great narratizations at the heart of church life. And when they are emptied out into cults of spontaneity and drained of their high seriousness, when they are acted unfelt and reasoned at with irresponsible objectivity, the center is gone and the widening gyres begin. The result in this age of communications has been worldwide: liturgy loosened into the casual, awe softening in relevance, and the washing out of that identity-giving historical definition that told man what he was and what he should be.</p>
<h2 id="sciencehasthesamegoalasalltherest">science has the same goal as all the rest</h2>
<p>Science then, for all its pomp of factness, is not unlike some of the more easily disparaged outbreaks of pseudoreligions. In this period of transition from its religious basis, science often shares with the celestial maps of astrology, or a hundred other irrationalisms, the same nostalgia for the Final Answer, the One Truth, the Single Cause. In the frustrations and sweat of laboratories, it feels the same temptations to swarm into sects, even as did the Khabiru refugees, and set out here and there through the dry Sinais of parched fact for some rich and brave significance flowing with truth and exaltation.</p>
<h2 id="religioninterwovenintosocietytaylor">religion interwoven into society (taylor)</h2>
<p>If we go back a few centuries in our civilization, we see that God was present in the above sense in a whole host of social practices—not just the political—and at all levels of society: for instance, when the functioning mode of local government was the parish, and the parish was still primarily a community of prayer; or when guilds maintained a ritual life that was more than pro forma; or when the only modes in which the society in all its components could display itself to itself were religious feasts, like, for instance, the Corpus Christi procession.</p>
<p>if you go back even farther in human history, you come to archaic societies in which the whole set of distinctions we make between the religious, political, economic, social, etc., aspects of our society ceases to make sense. In these earlier societies, religion was “everywhere”,2 was interwoven with everything else, and in no sense constituted a separate “sphere” of its own.</p>
<h2 id="whattobelieveanoptionamongmany">what to believe an option among many</h2>
<p>a move from a society where belief in God is unchallenged and indeed, unproblematic, to one in which it is understood to be one option among others, and frequently not the easiest to embrace.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it seems to me evident that there are big differences between these societies in what it is to believe, stemming in part from the fact that belief is an option, and in some sense an embattled option in the Christian (or “post-Christian”) society, and not (or not yet) in the Muslim ones.</p>
<p>So what I want to do is examine our society as secular in this third sense, which I could perhaps encapsulate in this way: the change I want to define and trace is one which takes us from a society in which it was virtually impossible not to believe in God, to one in which faith, even for the staunchest believer, is one human possibility among others.</p>
<h2 id="fullnessfromoutsideusgodtowithinustheindividual">fullness: from outside us (god) to within us (the individual)</h2>
<p>help us to situate a place of fullness, to which we orient ourselves morally or spiritually. They can orient us because they offer some sense of what they are of: the presence of God, or the voice of nature, or the force which flows through everything, or the alignment in us of desire and the drive to form.</p>
<p>for believers, the account of the place of fullness requires reference to God, that is, to something beyond human life and/or nature; where for unbelievers this is not the case; they rather will leave any account open, or understand fullness in terms of a potentiality of human beings understood naturalistically.</p>
<p>So there is the notion of receiving power or fullness in a relation; but the receiver isn’t simply empowered in his/her present condition; he/she needs to be opened, transformed, brought out of self. This is a very Christian formulation. In order to make the contrast with modern unbelief, perhaps it would be good to appose to it another formulation, more “Buddhist”: here the personal relation might drop out as central. But the emphasis would be all the stronger on the direction of transcending the self, opening it out, receiving a power that goes beyond us.</p>
<p>For modern unbelievers, the predicament is quite different. The power to reach fullness is within. This sense of ourselves as beings both frail and courageous, capable of facing a meaningless, hostile universe without faintness of heart, and of rising to the challenge of devising our own rules of life, can be an inspiring one,</p>
<p>people in earlier ages of our culture, for whom moving to fullness just meant getting closer to God.</p>
<p>We all learn to navigate between two standpoints: an “engaged” one in which we live as best we can the reality our standpoint opens us to; and a “disengaged” one in which we are able to see ourselves as occupying one standpoint among a range of possible ones, with which we have in various ways to coexist.</p>
<p>we have moved from a world in which the place of fullness was understood as unproblematically outside of or “beyond” human life, to a conflicted age in which this construal is challenged by others which place it (in a wide range of different ways) “within” human life.</p>
<h2 id="strangeconnectionbtwchristianityandbuddhism">strange connection btw christianity and buddhism</h2>
<p>In both Buddhism and Christianity, there is something similar in spite of the great difference in doctrine. This is that the believer or devout person is called on to make a profound inner break with the goals of flourishing in their own case; they are called on, that is, to detach themselves from their own flourishing, to the point of the extinction of self in one case, or to that of renunciation of human fulfillment to serve God in the other. The respective patterns are clearly visible in the exemplary figures. The Buddha achieves Enlightenment; Christ consents to a degrading death to follow his father’s will.</p>
<h2 id="theindividualasgod">the individual as god</h2>
<p>I would like to claim that the coming of modern secularity in my sense has been coterminous with the rise of a society in which for the first time in history a purely self-sufficient humanism came to be a widely available option. I mean by this a humanism accepting no final goals beyond human flourishing, nor any allegiance to anything else beyond this flourishing. Of no previous society was this true.</p>
<h2 id="agape">agape</h2>
<p>the Christian story of our potential transformation by agape requires that we see our life as going beyond the bounds of its “natural” scope between birth and death; our lives extend beyond “this life”.</p>
<p>A kingdom could only be conceived as grounded in something higher than mere human action in secular time.</p>
<p>But in the enchanted world, the meaning exists already outside of us, prior to contact; it can take us over, we can fall into its field of force. It comes on us from the outside.</p>
<h2 id="thepastaspresent">the past as present</h2>
<p>Our past is sedimented in our present, and we are doomed to misidentify ourselves, as long as we can’t do justice to where we come from.</p>
<p>Perhaps the clearest sign of the transformation in our world is that today many people look back to the world of the porous self with nostalgia. As though the creation of a thick emotional boundary between us and the cosmos were now lived as a loss. The aim is to try to recover some measure of this lost feeling. So people go to movies about the uncanny in order to experience a frisson. Our peasant ancestors would have thought us insane. You can’t get a frisson from what is really in fact terrifying you.</p>
<h2 id="theuniverseasgod">the universe as god</h2>
<p>Now imagine that this is not a theory, but how we sense things to be; and thus how we seem to experience them. Then the inside is no longer just inside; it is also outside. That is, emotions which are in the very depths of human life exist in a space which takes us beyond ourselves, which is porous to some outside power, a person-like power.</p>
<p>God figures in this world as the dominant spirit, and moreover, as the only thing that guarantees that in this awe-inspiring and frightening field of forces, good will triumph.</p>
<p>But living in the enchanted, porous world of our ancestors was inherently living socially. It was not just that the spiritual forces which impinged on me often emanated from people around me; e.g., the spell cast by my enemy, or the protection afforded by a candle which has been blessed in the parish church. Much more fundamental, these forces often impinged on us as a society, and were defended against by us as a society.</p>
<p>Turning “heretic” and rejecting this power, or condemning the practice as idolatrous, is not just a personal matter. Villagers who hold out, or even denounce the common rites, put the efficacy of these rites in danger, and hence pose a menace to everyone.</p>
<p>In these earlier days, societies, and not just parishes but whole kingdoms, were seen as standing together towards God, responsible for the “orthodoxy” (right praise) of their members. The deviancy of some would call down punishment on all.</p>
<h2 id="theorganizationofmedievalcatholicism">the organization of medieval catholicism</h2>
<p>Now without overlooking these points of tension, we can read medieval Catholicism in one way as incorporating a kind of equilibrium based on hierarchical complementarity. This was certainly recognized as an organizing principle for the society as a whole. For instance, the famous formula: the clergy pray for all, the lords defend all, the peasants labour for all, encapsulates the idea that society is organized in complementary functions, which nevertheless are of unequal dignity.</p>
<h2 id="thepoweroftheweakthroughreligiousmysticism">the power of the weak through religious mysticism</h2>
<p>Turner cites a number of African societies formed by militarily dominant invaders who have conquered the indigenous people. “The invaders control high political office, such as the kingship, provincial governorships, and headmanships. On the other hand, the indigenous people, through their leaders, frequently are held to have a mystical power over the fertility of the earth and of all on it. These autochthonous people have religious power, the ‘power of the weak’ as against the jural-political power of the strong, and represent the undivided land itself against the political system with its internal segmentation and hierarchies of authority.”</p>
<p>What all these situations have in common is that there is a play of structure and anti-structure, code and anti-code; this either takes the form of the code’s being momentarily suspended or transgressed; or else, as with the relation between conquerors and autochthonous above, the code itself allows for a counter-principle to the dominant source of power; it opens space for a complementary “power of the weak”.</p>
<p>But Turner puts them in the context of the pull of “communitas”, which takes us beyond this level of explanation. The sense of “communitas” is the intuition we all share that, beyond the way we relate to each other through our diversified coded roles, we also are a community of many-sided human beings, fundamentally equal, who are associated together. It is this underlying community which breaks out in moments of reversal or transgression, and which gives legitimacy to the power of the weak.</p>
<h2 id="eternityishighertime">eternity is 'higher time'</h2>
<p>‘eternity’. And that isn’t wrong, because it is the philosophically and theologically consecrated term for higher time.</p>
<p>Now higher times gather and re-order secular time. They introduce “warps” and seeming inconsistencies in profane time-ordering. Events which were far apart in profane time could nevertheless be closely linked. Benedict Anderson in a penetrating discussion of the some of the same issues I am trying to describe here, quotes Auerbach on the relation prefiguring-fulfilling in which events of the old Testament were held to stand to those in the New, for instance the sacrifice of Isaac and the Crucifixion of Christ. These two events were linked through their immediate contiguous places in the divine plan. They are drawn close to identity in eternity, even though they are centuries (that is, “aeons” or “saecula”) apart. In God’s time there is a sort of simultaneity of sacrifice and Crucifixion.</p>

<p>Running make me think that surely it soon be curfew so me can climb out of the gully and go somewhere where they be food to thief or water to drink, but me cuss ’cause there me was thinking about food again and me belly groan and cut me up with pain. Is true, you do feel better about things the further you run from it.</p>
<h2 id="leviticuslol">leviticus lol</h2>
<p>If a man call himself Rasta today, by next week that is him speaking prophecy. He don’t have to be too smart either, just know one or two hellfire and brimstone verse from the Bible. Or just claim it come from Leviticus since nobody ever read Leviticus. This is how you know. Nobody who get to the end of Leviticus can still take that book seriously. Even in a book full of it, that book is mad as shit.</p>
<p>most of the book is like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the offering to the Lord is a burnt offering of birds, you are to offer a dove or a young pigeon. 15 The priest shall bring it to the altar, wring off the head and burn it on the altar; its blood shall be drained out on the side of the altar. 16 He is to remove the crop and the feathers[a] and throw them down east of the altar where the ashes are. 17 He shall tear it open by the wings, not dividing it completely, and then the priest shall burn it on the wood that is burning on the altar. It is a burnt offering, a food offering, an aroma pleasing to the Lord.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="retributionasareflection">retribution as a reflection</h2>
<p>But Papa-Lo must have people seeing him do something. Like he making a difference on something that already gone and done and can’t change. He try to make an example out of her, burn down her entire life and kick her out with him own boot, but all he do was make an example out of himself. Like some naigger being extra wicked to impress the massa.</p>
<h2 id="astoneface">a stone face</h2>
<p>He trying to be brave, looking straight at me, eye to eye and frowning a little because he don’t know yet that you have to age into a stone face. It’s the first time he doing it, he know and I know, the son trying to stare down the father. But boy is a boy and not a man. He can’t hold it, not yet. He look aways first and just as quick turn on the stare again, but he just lose the round and he know it.</p>
<h2 id="immunefromretributionasmartcriminalvsafool">immune from retribution? a smart criminal vs a fool?</h2>
<p>So smart that he was the only one who catch the drift that after doing what we do there was not coming back. I like when a man can read writing on the wall. But Heckle should have known that he have nothing to worry about, retribution was coming for the stupid, not the smart. If I spoke to him I would have tell him, Brethren, don’t fret. The world smarter with you still in it.</p>
<h2 id="thefallacythatmansexpressionsrevolvesaroundher">the fallacy that mans expressions revolves around her</h2>
<p>This is something I’ve picked up from American women, this trying to read every single thing a man does as containing a secret message for me.</p>
<h2 id="thepastwhattodowiththepast">the past, what to do with the past</h2>
<p>You know I never think about the fucking past. That shit will fuck you up and you can’t fuck it back.</p>
<p>Every time I see you, you’re a different man.
—Me is the same man.
—No. You’re not. You just say you never think about the past. That’s why you can’t see what you look like.</p>
<p>Me don’t know what the r’ass you saying. Walking in and running your mouth with all sort of foolishness. Any more of this, a violin going start play.</p>
<h2 id="sadnessisathoughtpattern">sadness is a thought pattern</h2>
<p>When you are sad, know this need not be. Depression comes from a sense of being deprived of something you want and do not have. You remember that you are deprived of nothing except by your own decisions and then decide otherwise.</p>
<h2 id="moreaboutdepressionseeingitasaanobsessionwithonesidentityandabitaboutsuicide">more about depression, seeing it as a an obsession with one's identity (and a bit about suicide)</h2>
<p>Depression, by contrast, is based on an excessive relation to self. Wholly incapable of leaving the self behind, of transcending ourselves and relating to the world, we withdraw into our shells. The world disappears. We circle around ourselves, tortured by feelings of emptiness.</p>
<p>Today, narcissistic disorders are on the rise because we are increasingly losing the ability to conduct social interactions outside the boundaries of the self. The narcissistic homo psychologicus is captivated by itself, caught in an intricate inwardness. What results is a poverty in world, with the self simply circling around itself. Thus, homo psychologicus falls into a depression.</p>
<p>Rather, he is driven to it because life has become empty, meaningless and unbearable, because he is tired and exhausted, because he can no longer produce, can no longer produce himself. He commits suicide because of a rejection of life. It is not a voluntary death, but a forced death, a death out of exhaustion.</p>
<h2 id="lettinggodshinethroughyou">letting god 'shine through you'</h2>
<p>You are a mirror of truth, in which God himself shines in perfect light. To the ego's dark glass you need but say, "I will not look there because I know these images are not true." Then let the Holy One shine on you in peace, knowing that this and only this must be. His mind shone on you in your creation and brought your mind into being. His mind still shines on you and must shine through you. Your ego cannot prevent Him from shining on you, but it can prevent you from letting Him shine through you.</p>
<h2 id="intrinsicholiness">intrinsic holiness</h2>
<p>The point is to love all people. To have a belief in their intrinsic holiness.</p>
<p>Your gratitude to your brother is the only gift I want. I will bring it to God for you, knowing that to know your brother is to know God. If you are grateful to your brother, you are grateful to God for what he created. Through your gratitude you come to know your brother, and one moment of real recognition makes everyone your brother because each of them is of your Father. Love does not conquer all things, but it does set all things right.</p>
<h2 id="veryabstractdefinitionofantisocialbehaviour">very abstract definition of anti social behaviour</h2>
<p>Everything the ego perceives is a separate whole, without the relationships that imply being. The ego is thus against communication, except insofar as it is utilized to establish separateness rather than to abolish it. The communication system of the ego is based on its own thought system, as is everything else it dictates. Its communication is controlled by its need to protect itself, and it will disrupt communication when it experiences threat.</p>
<h2 id="theuniversalinspiration">the Universal Inspiration</h2>
<p>The word "know" is proper in this context, because the Holy Spirit is so close to knowledge that he calls it forth; or better, allows it to come. I have spoken before of the higher or "true" perception, which is so near to truth that God himself can flow across the little gap. Knowledge is always ready to flow everywhere, but it cannot oppose. Therefore you can obstruct it, although you can never lose it.</p>
<h2 id="youcannotthinkoutsideofgod">you cannot think outside of god</h2>
<p>God created one, and so you cannot eradicate it. You made the other, and so you can. Only what God creates is irreversible and unchangeable. What you made can always be changed because, when you do not think like God, you are not really thinking at all. Delusional ideas are not real thoughts, although you can believe in them. But you are wrong. The function of thought comes from God and is in God. As part of his Thought, you cannot think apart from him.</p>
<h2 id="onessystemofthoughtastheircentralidentity">one's system of thought as their central identity</h2>
<p>All who believe in separation have a basic fear of retaliation and abandonment. They believe in attack and rejection, so that is what they perceive and teach and learn. These insane ideas are clearly the result of dissociation and projection. What you teach you are, but it is quite apparent that you can teach wrongly, and can therefore teach yourself wrong. Many thought I was attacking them, even though it was apparent I was not. An insane learner learns strange lessons. What you must recognize is that when you do not share a thought system, you are weakening it. Those who believe in it therefore perceive this as an attack on them. This is because everyone identifies himself with his thought system, and every thought system centers on what you believe you are. If the center of the thought system is true, only truth extends from it. But if a lie is at its center, only deception proceeds from it.</p>
<h2 id="afoundationalwayofexisting">a foundational way of existing</h2>
<p>It is therefore essential to teach you that you must be included, and that the belief that you are not is the only thing that you must exclude.</p>
<h2 id="metaphorofritualsasahomeasawaytostructuretime">metaphor of rituals as a home, as a way to structure time</h2>
<p>We can define rituals as symbolic techniques of making oneself at home in the world. They transform being-in-the-world into a being-at-home. They turn the world into a reliable place. They are to time what a home is to space: they render time habitable. They even make it accessible, like a house. They structure time, furnish it.</p>
<p>Today, time lacks a solid structure. It is not a house but an erratic stream. It disintegrates into a mere sequence of point-like presences; it rushes off. There is nothing to provide time with any hold. Time that rushes off is not habitable.</p>
<h2 id="tobeatwarwiththeworldistobeatwarwithoneself">to be at war with the world is to be at war with oneself</h2>
<p>I said before that the ego's friend is not part of you, because the ego perceives itself at war and therefore in need of allies. You who are not at war must look for brothers and recognize all whom you see as brothers, because only equals are at peace. Because God's equal Sons have everything, they cannot compete. Yet if they perceive any of their brothers as anything other than their perfect equals, the idea of competition has entered their minds. Do not underestimate your need to be vigilant against this idea, because all your conflicts come from it. It is the belief that conflicting interests are possible, and therefore you have accepted the impossible as true. Is that different from saying you perceive yourself as unreal?</p>
<h2 id="thetotalityofallallbeingsallscenariosallsituationsaboundwithlove">the totality of all. all beings, all scenarios, all situations abound with love</h2>
<p>You are the Will of God. Do not accept anything else as your will, or you are denying what you are. Deny this and you will attack, believing you have been attacked. But see the love of God in you, and you will see it everywhere because it is everywhere. See his abundance in everyone, and you will know that you are in him with them. They are part of you, as you are part of God. You are as lonely without understanding this as God himself is lonely when his sons do not know him. The peace of God is understanding this. There is only one way out of the world's thinking, just as there was only one way into it. Understand totally by understanding totality.</p>
<h2 id="howbeliefcanbesoveryunbelievable">how belief can be so very unbelievable</h2>
<p>The Holy Spirit will teach you to perceive beyond your belief, because truth is beyond belief and his perception is true. The ego can be completely forgotten at any time, because it is a totally incredible belief, and no one can keep a belief he has judged to be unbelievable. The more you learn about the ego, the more you realize that it cannot be believed. The incredible cannot be understood because it is unbelievable. The meaninglessness of perception based on the unbelievable is apparent, but it may not be recognized as being beyond belief, because it is made by belief.</p>
<h2 id="youhavenocharisma">you have no charisma</h2>
<p>he said it to me, it's on my mind too much now</p>
<h2 id="sittingandreadingthenewspaperinabungalowwithaviewofthelakeinprospectpark">sitting and reading the newspaper in a bungalow with a view of the lake in prospect park</h2>
<p>Some men from south asia taking photos of one another. Of me, because i'm in the bungalow sitting there while they take pics - like a part of the scenery, a part of the culture of brooklyn. A young white male reading a newspaper.</p>
<p>A bunch of jewish girls graduating from something. They take one pic after the next, an older woman as a photographer. Teenage girls, 18 perhaps. The throwing of the hat up synchronously. This is so cute, they say over and over. Oh this is so fun, they say over and over. I read with occasional glad eyes witnessing the scene. Then one comes up to me, sir - do you mind if we use the bungalow. I say, of course. I get up, i leave.</p>
<h2 id="strangewayofseeingdepression">strange way of seeing depression</h2>
<p>When you are sad, know this need not be. Depression comes from a sense of being deprived of something you want and do not have. You remember that you are deprived of nothing except by your own decisions and then decide otherwise.</p>
<h2 id="fightforyourselffightagainstyourego">fight for yourself, fight against your ego</h2>
<p>Yet you are not efficient sufficiently vigilant against the demands of the ego to disengage itself. This need not be. The habit of engaging with God in His creations is easily made if you are Actively refuse to let your mind wander. The problem is one of concentration, a belief that no one - including yourself - is worth consistent effort. Side with me consistently against this deception, and do not permit this shabby belief to pull you back to being disheartened or useless to yourself and to me, only the ego can be disheartened.</p>
<h2 id="letgodshineonyou">let god shine on you</h2>
<p>You are a mirror of truth, in which God Himself shines in perfect light. To the ego's dark glass you need but say, "I will not look there because I know these images are not true." Then let the Holy One shine on you in peace, knowing that this and only this must be. His Mind shone on you in your creation and brought your mind into being. His Mind still shines on you and must shine through you. Your ego cannot prevent Him from shining on you, but it can prevent you from letting Him shine through you.</p>
<h2 id="thedebtyouowetothosewhohelpyoufindtheway">the debt you owe to those who help you find the way</h2>
<p>In learning to escape from illusions, your debt to your brother is something you must never forget.</p>
<p>I will go with you to the Holy One, and through my perception He can bridge the little gap. Your gratitude to your brother is the only gift I want. I will bring it to God for you, knowing that to know your brother <em>is</em> to know God. If you are grateful to your brother, you are grateful to God for what He created.</p>
<h2 id="imaginesayingthistosomeonerightaftertheywokeuphypnotic">imagine saying this to someone right after they woke up (hypnotic)</h2>
<p>Hear, then, the one answer of the Holy Spirit to all the questions the ego raises: You are a child of God, a priceless part of His Kingdom, which He created as part of Him. ²Nothing else exists and only this is real. ³You have chosen a sleep in which you have had bad dreams, but the sleep is not real and God calls you to awake. ⁴There will be nothing left of your dream when you hear Him, because you will awaken. ⁵Your dreams contain many of the ego’s symbols and they have confused you. ⁶Yet that was only because you were asleep and did not know. ⁷When you wake you will see the truth around you and in you, and you will no longer believe in dreams because they will have no reality for you. ⁸Yet the Kingdom and all that you have created there will have great reality for you, because they are beautiful and true.</p>
<h2 id="thecenterofathoughtsystem">the center of a thought system</h2>
<p><strong>What you must recognize is that when you do not share a thought system, you are weakening it. Those who believe in it therefore perceive this as an attack on them. This is because everyone identifies himself with his thought system, and every thought system centers on what you believe you are.</strong> If the center of the thought system is true, only truth extends from it. But if a lie is at its center, only deception proceeds from it.</p>
<h2 id="ritualasawaytoforgetoneselfasawaytoimproveonesattention">ritual as a way to forget oneself, as a way to improve one's attention</h2>
<p>Those who devote themselves to rituals must ignore themselves. Rituals produce a distance from the self, a self-transcendence. They depsychologize and de-internalize those enacting them.</p>
<p>In the face of increasing rates of attention deficit disorder, the introduction of ‘ritual studies’ as a school subject has recently been advocated as a means of reviving the exercise of ritual repetition as a cultural technique. Repetition stabilizes and deepens attention.</p>
<h2 id="digitalcommunicationasawaytoreinforceonesselfcenteredness">digital communication as a way to reinforce one's self centeredness</h2>
<p>Digital communication channels are filled with echo chambers in which the voices we hear are mainly our own. Likes, friends and followers do not provide us with resonance; they only strengthen the echoes of the self.</p>
<h2 id="anobsessionwithonesselfmakessocietymoreandmoreunconnected">an obsession with one's self makes society more and more unconnected</h2>
<p>Within the cult of authenticity, the production of self becomes a permanent activity. Authenticity thus atomizes society.</p>
<h2 id="beingpoliteasawaytodestroyboundaries">being polite as a way to destroy boundaries</h2>
<p>One hearty laugh together will bring enemies into a closer communion of heart than hours spent on both sides in inward wrestling with the mental demon of uncharitable feeling. To wrestle with a bad feeling only pins our attention on it, and keeps it still fastened in the mind; whereas if we act as if from some better feeling, the old bad feeling soon folds its tent like an Arab and silently steals away.</p>
<p>A ritual of politeness is not an expression of subjective feeling; it is an objective act. It resembles a magical invocation that produces a positive mental state.</p>
<h2 id="societieslossofritualdestroyingtheartofbeingallformsofartforthatmatter">societies loss of ritual destroying the art of being -- all forms of art for that matter</h2>
<p>Today, the arts are increasingly rendered profane and disenchanted. Magic and enchantment – the true sources of art – disappear from culture, to be replaced by discourse. The enchanting exterior is replaced with the true interior, the magic signifier with the profane signified. The place of compelling, captivating forms is taken by discursive content, Magic gives way to transparency. The imperative of transparency fosters an animosity to form. Art becomes transparent with regard to its meaning. It no longer seduces. The magic veil is cast off. The forms do not themselves talk. The language of forms, of signifiers, is characterised by compression, complexity, equivocation, exaggeration, a high degree of ambiguity that even reaches the level of contradiction. These suggest meaningfulness without immediately being reducible to meaning. All these now disappear, and instead we are confronted with simplified claims and messages that are artificially imposed on the work of art.</p>
<h2 id="modernmajorfestivalsconcertsetcasanextensionoftheself">modern major festivals (concerts, etc.) as an extension of the self</h2>
<p>They are an intense form of life. In the festival, life relates to itself instead of subordinating itself to external purposes.</p>
<p>Today’s popular festivals have become mass events, and masses are not communities.</p>
<h2 id="whatisahaiku">what is a haiku</h2>
<p>In the haiku, the limitation of language is the object of a concern which is inconceivable to us, for it is not a question of being concise (i.e., shortening the signifier without diminishing the density of the signified) but on the contrary of acting on the very root of meaning, so that this meaning will not melt, run, internalize, become implicit, disconnect, divagate … the haiku is not a rich thought reduced to a brief form, but a brief event which immediately finds its proper form.</p>
<h2 id="modernwarfareasadisconnectingforcebtwthewarringparties">modern warfare as a disconnecting force btw the warring parties</h2>
<p>Superiority in the topological sense, that is, in the sense of being above the enemy, generates a different mental attitude towards the enemy. The asymmetry in the means of destruction at each party’s disposal leads the superior one to adopt an altogether different estimation of the enemy. The enemy is degraded into the criminal: ‘The superior force considers its superiority in weaponry to be proof of its iusta causa and declares the enemy to be a criminal, because it is no longer possible to realize the concept of iustus hostis.’</p>
<p>With drone warfare, we reach the pinnacle of asymmetry. The degradation and transformation of the opponent into a criminal is the precondition of targeted killing, which resembles a kind of policing. Drone warfare completely dispenses with the reciprocity, the reciprocal relationship, that constitutes war as ritual combat. The attacker is wholly invisible. A screen is not an opponent.</p>
