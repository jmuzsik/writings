<p>"In the early stages of training, an aspiring Confucian gentleman needs to memorise entire shelves of archaic texts, learn the precise angle at which to bow, and learn the lengths of the steps with which he is to enter a room.<br />
His sitting mat must always be perfectly straight.<br />
All of this rigour and restraint, however, is ultimately aimed at producing a cultivated, but nonetheless genuine, form of spontaneity.<br />
Indeed, the process of training is not considered complete until the individual has passed completely beyond the need for thought or effort.”</p>

<p>"The desire to be right and the desire to have been right are two desires, and the sooner we separate them the better off we are. The desire to be right is the thirst for truth. On all counts, both practical and theoretical, there is nothing but good to be said for it. The desire to have been right, on the other hand, is the pride that goeth before a fall. It stands in the way of our seeing we were wrong, and thus blocks the progress of our knowledge." - Willard Van Orman Quine and J.S. Ullian</p>

<p>"…one day, alone in the kitchen with my father, I let drop a few whines about the job. I gave him details, examples of what troubled me, yet although he listened intently, I saw no sympathy in his eyes. No “Oh, you poor little thing.”</p>
<p>Perhaps he understood that what I wanted was a solution to the job, not an escape from it. In any case, he put down his cup of coffee and said, “Listen. You don’t live there. You live here. With your people. Go to work. Get your money. And come on home.”</p>
<p>That was what he said. This was what I heard:</p>
<ol>
<li>Whatever the work is, do it well—not for the boss but for yourself.</li>
<li>You make the job; it doesn’t make you.</li>
<li>Your real life is with us, your family.</li>
</ol>
<p>I have worked for all sorts of people since then, geniuses and morons, quick-witted and dull, bighearted and narrow. I’ve had many kinds of jobs, but since that conversation with my father I have never considered the level of labor to be the measure of myself, and I have never placed the security of a job above the value of home."</p>

<p>"He saw the center of any religion as residing not in books or doctrines, but deep in the heart of each individual. Though his devotion to the teaching of Mohammed was unequivocal, he viewed the inner reaches of Islam, Christianity, Judaism, and Buddhism as merging into one. At times he raised a single index finger, as if this said everything: One. And the prayer beads dangling from his hands were not a cultural ornament or distracting habit. His fingers moved the beads in a continual, silent, circumference."</p>
