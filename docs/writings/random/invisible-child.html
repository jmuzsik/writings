<p>It is a less-known fact that Brooklyn was built on the backs of slaves, brought here by the Dutch in 1626 to clear land, build roads, and work the tobacco plantations. When the British took the colony nearly four decades later, renaming it for the Duke of York, the importation of slaves began in earnest. The colony’s enslaved population swelled to 13,500, making it the largest slaveholding territory in the North. And nowhere in New York was the concentration of slaves higher than in Brooklyn—one-third of the population. (Location 735)</p>
<p>Thousands of enslaved Blacks took up arms in the Revolutionary War—some for the British, who promised them freedom, and some for the rebels (after George Washington reluctantly allowed them to fight). The biggest battle unfolded in Brooklyn, when the British took control of New York’s port. They captured tens of thousands of Continental troops, including an estimated three thousand Black soldiers who languished on jail ships in New York’s Wallabout Bay—the same waters that their African forebears had crossed in slave vessels. A prisoner’s best chance at survival—white or Black—was to denounce the rebels and join the British. The corpses of as many as 11,500 prisoners, wasted from hunger and disease, were tossed overboard, their bones washing up along Brooklyn’s shores. The prisoners’ remains are now interred in Fort Greene Park, beneath the granite Prison Ship Martyrs Monument, topped by an eight-ton urn. A sandstone slab honors those who “perished in the cause of liberty,” proclaiming them “the spirits of the departed free.” (Location 740)</p>
<p>Take 81 Adelphi Street, two blocks east of Fort Greene Park. Long before this property came under renovation (selling for $2.1 million in 2017), it was the nineteenth-century home of Charles A. Dorsey, a legendary figure of Fort Greene’s long-lost Black elite. His name adorns the elementary school that Dasani once attended—a place that matters, she will tell you, because it was Brooklyn’s first school for Black children. Originally named the African Free School, it opened in 1827—the same year that slavery in New York ended under the state’s “gradual abolition” laws. This is not to say that white northerners were tolerant. Contrary to New York City’s image as a progressive beacon, it was a Manhattan-born minstrel named Thomas Dartmouth Rice who in the 1830s invented the slave caricature Jim Crow—a mockery, performed in blackface, that came to personify segregation. If Brooklyn’s Black children wanted an education, the African Free School was their only option. Another eighteen years passed—the lifespan of a childhood—before the Board of Education, in 1845, admitted the free school into the public system, renaming it Colored School No. 1 and moving it to Willoughby Street, facing what is now Fort Greene Park.

<p>Racial tensions had long been simmering when, in 1863, Irish immigrants in Manhattan mounted one of the most violent anti-Black insurrections in American history. Angered by a law drafting them to fight in the Civil War—ostensibly to free slaves who might then take their jobs—rioters filled the streets, lynching Black people and burning down the Colored Orphan Asylum on Fifth Avenue as 233 children escaped out the back. Brooklyn, by comparison, was a haven. Fleeing the draft riots, thousands of Black families left Manhattan for Brooklyn, finding an anchor in the Fort Greene school. This prominent tide included African American scholars, entrepreneurs, doctors, and an inventor. They launched businesses, started newspapers, formed literary clubs, and organized politically, transforming the area into the so-called Black Belt. “WEALTHY NEGRO CITIZENS,” announced The New York Times in 1895, noting that “most of the wealthy negroes” live in Brooklyn—some with white servants and horse-drawn carriages. As many as seventy-one African Americans bought homes, forming the base of Fort Greene’s Black intelligentsia, spiritual leadership, and civil rights vanguard. (Location 982)</p>
<p>Instead, the names of Brooklyn’s slave-holding families dominate the terrain. Boerum Hill (named for Simon Boerum, a man with three slaves). Wyckoff Street (Peter Wyckoff, enslaver of seven). Ditmas Park (four slaves). Luquer Street (thirteen). Van Brunt Street (seven). Cortelyou Road (two). Both Van Dam and Bayard streets are named for the owners of slave ships, while Stuyvesant Heights is named for the man who governed the New Netherland colony of the Dutch West India Company, which shipped tens of thousands of slaves.

<p>By the end of the war, June’s regiment had liberated two cities from the Nazis. “The Italians knew we were going to fight the dreaded Germans and that some of us would not come back,” Ivan wrote. “They threw flowers at our vehicles. They handed flowers and wine to those of us riding in the vehicles. They threw kisses at us.” For decades to come, the Buffalo Soldiers’ heroics would be taught in Italian grade schools and reenacted by Italian civilians, while going largely ignored in America. (Location 1483)</p>
<p>If June wanted to buy a home, he had one advantage over other African Americans: as a veteran, he qualified for a GI Bill–backed mortgage. But he also lived in Bed-Stuy, where a policy of racial exclusion was well under way. Back in 1904, a New York Times editorial had warned that renting or selling property to Black buyers would “depress real estate values.” With nativism on the rise, the Ku Klux Klan (which had 150,000 members in New York City) visited a church in Bed-Stuy in 1929 to endorse the minister’s exclusion of Black parishioners. As more Black people moved to Bed-Stuy, the city withheld sufficient policing and other services. The neighborhood’s fate was sealed in 1935, when the federal Home Owners’ Loan Corporation began color-coding American cities, using race as a criterion to identify risky investment areas on the map. African American hubs like Bed-Stuy were marked in red for “hazardous.” If you lived in a redlined zone, it was almost impossible to get a mortgage. (Location 1521)</p>
<p>Yet home ownership was key to accruing wealth. White American families would eventually amass a median net worth nearly ten times that of Black families. Put another way, the exclusion of African Americans from real estate—not to mention college, white-collar jobs, and the ability to vote—laid the foundations of a lasting poverty that Dasani would inherit.

<p>1986—the same year that Chanel discovered her mother’s crack pipe—Congress approved a new law making punishment for crack possession (common among the poor) one hundred times more harsh than for powder cocaine (common among the wealthy). Even first-time crack offenders landed mandatory minimum sentences of five to ten years, contributing to the explosion of America’s prison population—a disproportionately Black and Latino group that came to include Chanel’s two brothers, an uncle, and four cousins. Within a decade, this population would surpass a million. The United States had claimed the highest incarceration rate in the world. (Location 1679)</p>

<p>Society’s answer to poverty, time and again, was to separate children from their families. By the early twentieth century, about 93,000 children were living in orphanages and as many as 75,000 more in foster homes or facilities for juvenile delinquents. (Location 2995)</p>
<p>Black women had to fight to join welfare’s rolls. Drawn north by the Great Migration, millions of African Americans had resettled in New York City, which became the base for a national welfare rights movement. By 1975, 11 million Americans were receiving welfare cash, most of them children and single mothers. Black families made up 44 percent of this group while representing less than 10 percent of the nation’s population. (Location 3022)</p>
<p>New York City is the only American metropolis that guarantees the legal right to shelter, year-round, for both families and single adults, including non-pregnant women. But in practice, shelter gets denied and food stamps cut off with the vagaries of each city administration. (Location 3058)</p>

<p>She is, in the parlance of experts (including her former teacher, Miss Hester), the “parentified” child. In chaotic, trauma-prone families—rich or poor—firstborn children tend to take on parental duties. This can make them self-sufficient, quick on their feet, and adept at survival. But once they assume a parental role, they have trouble transitioning back to childlike behavior. They are more resistant to authority and less trusting of people. They often struggle to develop lasting emotional bonds, having learned to care for themselves rather than leaving the task to anyone else. (Location 4688)</p>
<p>Over half of all Black children in America are subjected to at least one child protection probe before turning eighteen. They are 2.4 times more likely than whites to be permanently separated from their parents, entering a foster care population of more than 427,000 children nationally. So prevalent is the view that Black parents are being criminalized—many of them mothers like Chanel—that advocates have nicknamed this practice Jane Crow. (Location 4743)</p>

<p>But if the goal of prevention, per the ACS website, is to “stabilize families at risk of a crisis,” the federal government makes this difficult. ACS is currently spending, in 2015, about $532 million on foster care—more than twice what it spends on prevention. Around 44 percent of ACS’s budget depends on federal funds, of which the lion’s share goes to foster care and adoption services—not prevention. Put another way: More than a century after President Theodore Roosevelt’s landmark conference concluded that America’s homes “should not be broken up for reasons of poverty,” the federal government is giving ten times as much money to programs that separate families (most of them poor) as to programs that might preserve them.

<p>While the crime bill would later haunt the presidential bids of Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden, the Adoption and Safe Families Act has received far less attention. Under this law, once a child has spent fifteen months in foster care, the state’s child protection agency (with few exceptions) must move toward ending parental rights. Otherwise, the state cannot be federally reimbursed for the cost of foster care. (Location 6638)</p>
<p>He begins a short lecture on the law, explaining to Chanel that the standard is different in family court. It is not like criminal law, which requires proving a case “beyond a reasonable doubt.” In family law, all ACS needs is to demonstrate “a preponderance of evidence,” which he likens to “a feather or a paper clip” that “tilts in favor of the prosecution.” (Location 6651)</p>

<p>The word “understand” comes from Old English—understandan. Literally, it means “to stand in the midst of.” It does not mean we have reached some ultimate truth. It means, to my mind, that we have experienced enough of something new, something formerly unseen, to be provoked, humbled, awakened, or even changed by it. If I did anything in my eight years with Dasani, it was to stand in the midst of her life. (Location 8435)</p>
