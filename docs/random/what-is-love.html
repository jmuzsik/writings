<ul>
<li>A 75-year longitudinal study by Harvard researchers suggests that love is indeed key to a happy and fulfilling life.</li>
<li>Love never involves deception, because misleading another person fractures his or her sense of reality.</li>
<li>Love is not a fantasy bond</li>
<li>Too often, we think of love as an almost passive state of being, as opposed to a conscious choice we make… In other words, we come to see ourselves and our partner as a single unit. We then fall into roles rather than appreciating each other as individuals and experiencing the exciting, loving feelings that result.</li>
<li>It's important to distinguish emotional hunger from real love.</li>
<li>Love should never be an act of manipulation. It is not a mark of ownership over another person, but the exact opposite—a genuine appreciation of a person as a separate individual.</li>
<li>To become more loving thus means recognizing ways we self-sabotage: How are we recreating past hurts in our current relationships?</li>
<li>One of the biggest reasons we shut out love is because we feel unworthy or self-denying. Therefore, to have a loving relationship, we must challenge our negative self-concept or critical inner voice.</li>
