<p>These are the words of a man named Abdul Malek, who has been arguing for decades of a rethinking of the philosophical foundation of modern physics. His home territory has been forums and his ideas are powerfully original. Reading this man's words one cannot help but get the sense of a psychologically obscure individual with a commanding use of ideas. One sees a man repeatedly yelling out to the wind, with responses to his expressions containing a sense of a combination of awe and pity. I have partially went through a forum he has been commenting in for several years which he began titled: Is Any Effective Refutation of Einstein’s Theories of Relativity Possible?. What I have searched for is the times where he shows the essence of his thought. His thought is not solely about physics but contains an entire worldview that touches upon the foundations of the most fundamental concepts that exist, such as the meaning of mathematics, epistemology, conscience, and so much more. What is created is a collage of these comments. Slightly edited, reordered, and with a rare sentence here or there(in subdued tone) written to keep the piece as connected as I could. Here is a view of this fascinating independent thinker of modern physics.</p>
<p>Dear fellow heretics, opponents of modern official theoretical physics and cosmology; and the proponents of credible novel and counter-theories:</p>
<p>Intro quote: “There is nothing permanent except change.” - Heraclitus</p>
<p>Let us begin with epistemology. One can approach with causality; the view that an omnipotent and omniscient creator created the world and is behind the workings of everything. Or with the intuition of Heraclitus (544 – 483 B.C.), who posited that everything in the universe comes into being and passes out of existence due to inner strife or contradiction; meaning that "change" is the only absolute attribute of the universe. This idea of Heraclitus points to an evolutionary process of the world that everything evolves from some fundamental unit, later conceived by Democritus (~ 420 BC) as atoms. A general sense of short-term cause and effect is essential for any life form, even in its most primitive stage. Causality was therefore the most intuitive to ordinary thinking of man; hence it became the predominant mode of epistemology.</p>
<p>The Greeks also brought about the idealisation of Mathematics, attributed to Pythagoras. Plato formalised this principle in his philosophy, where mathematics along with the universals was placed in a world beyond space and time - a realm higher than this world which our senses cannot perceive. The higher realm, which is presented to thought alone; is the unchanging reality, where there is perfection, permanence and absolute order. In idealism, material existence is not real but it is an illusion or "Maya" in Sanskrit.  This view of mathematics extended to causal relationships in the Greek world. There, mathematics found its fame in an abstract and alienated form with the early Greeks; as the perfect creation of God and the physical world as but its crude representation. The view of creation was that the world must be finite in time and also limited in extension.</p>
<p>Aristotle extended this viewpoint with the principle of “Unity, Opposition and the Excluded Middle”. This view absolutely prohibits contradiction in the world, everything is created perfect in itself and only isolated polar opposites are allowed to exist without any unity among them. Any change, motion, or development in this view must be induced from an outside omnipotent purpose in a deterministic way.</p>
<p>The idealisation of mathematics led to the early Greeks keeping themselves preoccupied with endless geometrical deductions that went nowhere. Similar is the case with medieval theological scholasticism or the Eastern mysticism and spiritualism. This kind of preoccupation has some aesthetic, cultural, spiritual, psychological, etc. values and has given rise to arts, music and rituals; but nothing much in terms of enhancing positive knowledge (knowledge corresponding to objective reality/useful for man) about the world and man; in the spirit of natural sciences. </p>
<pre><code>"This most beautiful system of the sun, planets and comets, could only proceed from the counsel and dominion of an intelligent and powerful Being." - Newton says, an example of bringing God into physics
</code></pre>
<p>But the notion that the creator is the sole cause behind everything and is omnipotent without any rival or contradiction began to fray with social practice and specially with the development of technology and natural science. Theology as the arbiter of social affairs had to bring in the idea of Evil (Satan) for any anomaly in omnipotent God’s perfect world, while natural science began looking for causes in Nature to explain things in an empirical way. While theology and mysticism took a top-down approach starting from the mystery of the “first cause”; the bottom-up approach of empirical natural science based on causality leads to the same mystery of a “first cause”. But if you start from a mystery or end up in a mystery through a series of steps of cause and effect (as in empirical science); the whole process based on this epistemology are in actual fact mysteries and do not qualify as positive knowledge; except in some arbitrary sense based on social/historical practice and technology.</p>
<p>In classical physics, confusing and mutually contradictory “data” in a particular domain accumulated for some time and investigation and practice was carried out in the dark and depended on chance outcome, until a brilliant intuition in the form of a theory (conveniently formulated mathematically) brought an AH HA moment and illuminated the whole area and brought the hazy and patchy picture and the confusing “data” into a coherent whole. This illumination by the theory was not confined to the old area of investigation alone, but it was extended to the surrounding area and opened the door to new search and so on. In other words in the past theory arose from "data" and practice, not "data" arising from theory!</p>
<p>While this was the process Newton himself went through, parsing through the "data" to find theories, being the father of classical physics. He could not let go of the notion of causality and allowed the philosophical tradition to live on, though his discoveries were in direct contradiction to this mode of epistemology.</p>
<p>"The history of the world is none other than the progress of the consciousness of freedom." - Hegel says in connection with what Abdul believes to be right</p>
<p>Contradiction always was a bugbear in a class society all through history; which always wanted permanence, continuity, and harmony; but no opposition, no contradiction that will entail conflict and change. The recognition of contradiction in philosophy came with Hume and particularly with Kant, who proved conclusively that beyond ordinary life experience and classical mechanics, objective reality is full of contradictions because of the breakdown of causality. Because of this Kant discarded reality as an unknowable thing-in-itself to save his cherished causality and notions of rationalism.</p>
<p>It fell on Hegel to restore the honour of philosophy as the science of all sciences, the soul of all knowledge, by pulling it out of its intractable problems of causality and the lowest moment it reached during the time of Kant. Hegel unambiguously rejected the law of non-contradiction of theology, old idealism, rationalism and classical materialism, the “excluded middle” of Aristotle and the thing-in-itself of Kant. For Hegel absolutely everything depends on “the identity of identity and non-identity.” Opposites reside together in the very element of a thing or a process in simultaneous unity and opposition to each other and a resolution of this rational contradiction (and inner conflict) provides the dynamics for change, motion, evolution, development, etc. in the universe. </p>
<p>Hegel thus revived and reinforced the dialectics of Heraclitus, but to a higher degree of epistemology; propelled by the knowledge of the past few centuries of historical, scientific and social development of man. Hegel’s dialectics in its materialist form not only provides a solid basis for positive knowledge of the world, nature, history, society and thought; it points to a way to have a grip and an understanding of the infinite universe that man can be comfortable with.</p>
<p>Philosophy came to an end (in my opinion) with the dialectics of Hegel. Because, if the aim of all philosophy was to know the ultimate truth of the world, Hegel’s dialectics showed that this task is impossible because there is a contradiction between man and the world, between the subjective and objective of Nature. This contradiction can only resolve itself through the historical and the dialectical evolution of man as an iterative and never ending process. So, human knowledge remains limited objectively through the historical stage and develops but never reaches the final truth, which will be the end of the contradiction - an impossibility.</p>
<p>“Mankind therefore finds itself faced with a contradiction; on the one hand, it has to gain an exhaustive knowledge of the world system in all in its interrelations; and on the other hand, because of the nature both of man and of the world system, this task can never be completely fulfilled. But this contradiction lies not only in the nature of the two factors – the world, and man – it is also the main lever of all intellectual advance, and finds its solution continuously, day by day, in the endless progressive evolution of humanity just as for example mathematical problems find their solution in an infinite series or continued fractionations. Each mental image of the world system is and remains in actual fact limited, objectively through the historical stage and subjectively through the physical and mental constitution of its maker.”( Frederick Engels, Anti-Duhring)</p>
<p>Marx/Engels brought along a new epistemology in the mid 1800's called dialectical materialism, extending the epistemology of Hegel. This emphasised the importance of real-world conditions in the search of knowledge. For materialist dialectics, the material universe is self-determined, without any necessity of providence of any kind! And also, "It is not the consciousness of men that determines their being, but their social being that determines their consciousness." Any knowledge (mathematics included) in its final analysis can only be relative to man, his material existence in a society and his practice.</p>
<p>For dialectic materialists, the Universe, Nature, Life, Society and Thought are not mediated by blind “chance” but with an iron dialectical “necessity” that is inherent in chance and not by a “cause” followed by an “effect” as causality proposes. Dialectics deals only with relative truth of the world and better approximation is gained in an iterative way through a historical process. For dialectics, the most fundamental attribute of existence is “matter in eternal motion". This motion is burdened with the contradiction of “absolute free motion” and its restriction under special circumstances; gravitation is the most universal form of such restriction; electromagnetism, nuclear energy, etc. are special ones. The resolution of this fundamental contradiction at various levels is what gives rise to the manifestation and the phenomenology of the universe. The concept of space and time are interrelated. For dialectics, if space is infinite, then time has to be infinite and hence, eternal. Infinite means there is no end and any addition, subtraction or any mathematical operation leaves the infinite unchanged!</p>
<p>For dialectics there is no independent beginning or a separate end. The beginning and end lie together in a contradiction, which Hegel expressed as “Being-Nothing”, from which a “Becoming” evolves. The "Becoming" in its turn, forms a "Being" for another triadic movement and so on and this movement can go in the opposite direction. For Heraclitus, everything in the universe comes into being in their own unique ways, always changing in discrete stages as long as they are in existence, eventually passing out of existence. For dialectics, “change” through discrete qualitative and quantitative leaps in various stages is the absolute attribute of the universe. In this sense, the universe is like an infinite, eternal and ever-changing living organism whose old cells (so to speak) die out of existence and new ones are formed as replacements.</p>
<p>Chance is implicit in necessity and vice versa; one can never be without the other; like Being-Nothing – the primary contradiction. In dialectics there can be no “Being” by itself or “Nothing” by itself – they must always be together. The only way this contradiction can be removed is by ending existence itself (an impossibility), where “Being” and “Nothing” mutually annihilate each other. This also means that there can be no beginning or end of the universe, unlike the point of view of causality.</p>
<p>The question whether objective truth can be attributed to human thinking is not a question of theory but a practical question. In practice man must prove the truth, i.e., the reality and power, the “this-sidedness” of his thinking. The dispute over the reality or non-reality of thinking which is isolated from practice is a purely scholastic question.
Marx</p>
<p>According to dialectical materialism, "Thought" is a derivative of "Matter" ; Thought can roam around freely as it wishes, but does not have an independent existence of its own (in the form of mathematics for example). "Thought" is not outside of "Matter". Geometrical forms arose from the real world through the concrete practice of men for their tangible need. Geometry/mathematics (like many other things, such as God, Kings, State, Capital etc.) are the creations of men for the need of their practical social life. But at a certain stage of their development, these creations go out of the control of men like a Frankenstein monster, as if these are independent alien powers coming from outside to which men must now be subservient to. </p>
<p>But the fact is that until now society is made up of classes of people and there always is a ruling class that decides on all important aspects of social life of any epoch. Thus the ruling ideas (including scientific ones) of an epoch are the ideas of its ruling class, This is a historical fact. Monopoly capitalism as an alienating (Frankenstein) monster turns everybody into workers; the honourable and esteemed “scientists” and professionals serve the highest bidder. Gone are the days of the free thinkers, the passionate and creative giants who pursued their profession for the mere thirst of knowledge under the most severe conditions and often under the threat of persecution and death. </p>
<p>They are now replaced by troops of conformed "scientist serfs" who are totally dependent on monopoly capital for their livelihood, career and crafts and who toil mightily to bring out only expected and acceptable results. It is the same for the developments in Nature, where contradictions are resolved mediated through chance and an iron necessity that is inherent in chance itself. It is a vulgar opportunism perpetrated by all ruling classes of history to hide the reality, the contradiction, the conflicts in society and Nature; presenting these as harmonious and requiring no change; presenting themselves as the representatives of “everybody”.</p>
<p>“Our experience hitherto justifies us in believing that nature is the realization of the simplest conceivable mathematical ideas. I am convinced that we can discover by means of purely mathematical constructions the concepts and the laws connecting them with each other, which furnish the key to the understanding of natural phenomena. … In a certain sense, therefore, I hold it true that pure thought can grasp reality, as the ancients dreamed” (Einstein)</p>
<p>Moving onto Quantum Mechanics, just like the recognition of antinomies in the philosophy of Kant - the recognition of quantum uncertainty in physics, led to a breakdown of the time honoured notions of causality, certainty, determinism, idealism, rationalism and classical materialism that was in force since Aristotle. This breakdown also raised the spectre of uncertainty and brought in the much despised contradictions of dialectical chance and necessity in pristine philosophy and physics.</p>
<p>Dialectical chance and necessity is in conformity with the quantum phenomena. For dialectics “chance” engenders “necessity” and vice versa. Chance is blind only when it is not realised in a necessity. Everything in the universe: Nature, Life, History, Society and Thought are mediated by chance and necessity, the difference with the quantum phenomena is that it demonstrates chance and necessity in a very dramatic way. The macroscopic scale is the gross, averaged out state of the quantum “chance and necessity” processes going on in the micro scale. Hegel, through his dialectics - anticipated the quantum phenomena. Quantum uncertainty is not a simple problem of the uncertainty of the simultaneous measurement of the parameters of permanently existing quantum particles, as is commonly thought; the problem lies with the instability and uncertainty of objective reality itself, at the fundamental level of ontology of the quantum particles!</p>
<p>The breakdown of causality in physics with the recognition of the quantum phenomena led Einstein to follow Kant’s approach of subjective idealism and sought to impose on the universe his subjective “mathematical categories”, developed through thought of his own and of previous mathematicians. This is where things stand now; but the mystery of causality prevails both in philosophy and physics; with no sign that a case for positive knowledge can be made from the world view of causality.</p>
<p>And here lies the tragedy and the pitiful state of official physics (the accepted philosophies of physics). Physicists want to impose their fabricated “beautiful theories” on Nature, without caring at all whether this would fit her or if she wants to own such beauty! Like a three year old, Nature does what she wants and is highly unlikely to oblige with “demands “ of her! You need prudent thought and graceful approach to see only the natural beauty she has or to win her mind – like a character in Tagore’s poem say, “The mind of a woman, my friend, is worth the devotion of thousands of year!”</p>
<p>The theories of relativity (and other field-based theories) are conceived in the head of a “lone genius of mathematics” and impose this on the world, whether it likes it or not. Physicists “create” “data” to “prove” the theories. The “proofs” of these esoteric theories are achieved by creating “data” through contrived experiments and by corrupting the “scientists” with the lure of fame, fortune, position and funds. Since only monopoly capitalism is capable of this feat; you get “data” in support of its ruling theories and scientists get totally spooked and taken in; because of their naïve faith in “data” only.</p>
<p>Just as it was with the early Greeks, idealised mathematics and Platonism has become the religion of modern  physics since Einstein. Mathematical acrobatics dazzles physics. Prominent physicists disparage philosophy at every turn and tout “mathematical consistency” instead, as the only way to know the ultimate truth of the world - a “Theory of everything”, “The Mind of God”, etc. Is this knowledge or is this natural science in the usual sense of the term that we know?</p>
<p>I have many criticism of the theories of relativity from the point of view materialist dialectics.</p>
<p>Several are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The principled ground that axiom or premise based theories can never reflect material objective reality and hence have no validity for science.</li>
<li>There is no tangible social/ historical practice that would qualify them as positive knowledge.</li>
<li>I question the subjective experimental and observational “proofs” as valid criteria for the theories. The experimental “proof” of the theories seems to be subjective with confirmation bias and a strong belief in the correctness of the theories. They are contrived and forced interpretations of data barely above the background electronic noise and obtained through untested technology at the highest level of modern capability. My assertion is that other interpretations of the some observational evidence based on different perspective are possible, but not considered as credible, because those go against the official view.</li>
<li>The “4D-spacetime” based ontological concept of objective reality in General Relativity has no validity because it is an abstract mathematical construct that has no material, physical, and real foundation. This artificial concept of objective reality was necessary to build causality based theories, starting from abstract and ideal axioms, premises, pre-suppositions etc., and not from empirical facts; as was the usual practice previously.</li>
<li>After more than a hundred years of our pre-occupation with these theories, not a single case of their tangible use or practice exists. The validity of these theories are claimed solely based on subjective, contrived and doubtful experimental results. In classical mechanics/Newtonian physics no such century long experimental proofs of scientific proofs were necessary. Social practice, technology was enough for the validity of theories.</li>
</ul>
<p>Gravity can also be explained through dialectric materialism rather than relativity. It is a contradiction with universal free motion and at all times resolves this contradiction at various levels of existing matter. On the surface of a large material body, gravity is absolute such that “absolute free motion” of a smaller body is severely restricted, but the contradiction is not totally eliminated. At distances away from the surface of the material body this contradiction takes different forms depending on the circumstances.</p>
<p>"It is becoming equally imperative to bring the individual spheres of knowledge into the correct connection with one another. In doing so, however, natural science enters the field of theory and here the methods of empiricism will not work, here only theoretical thinking can be of assistance. But theoretical thinking is an innate quality only as regards natural capacity. This natural capacity must be developed, improved, and for its improvement there is as yet no other means than the study of previous philosophy." - Marx</p>
<p>The scientific enterprise must focus on positive knowledge. This is at loggerheads with modern theories such as relativity as the scientific basis for the inferences derived from these theories are sought exclusively through the experimental or observational “proof” of the prediction made by the theories. These "proofs" are based on technologies at the very limit of present capabilities and with data that are barely above baseline electronic noise. In other words they have become a (mathematical) theory driven enterprise equipped with uncertain tools. It wants to selectively see only those things and processes that the axiomatic theories lead it to! In other words this approach becomes subjective so is prone to confirmation bias and corruption induced by the lure of fame, fortune and funds. This approach also become amenable to the manipulation of influential ideological, theological, political, financial interest groups and hence completely unsuitable for gaining objective knowledge of the world.</p>
<p>As I insisted earlier, it is my view that our exploration of the cosmos should be guided not by mathematical idealism and causality based epistemology that lead only to mysteries, but by materialist dialectics. We already have some limited knowledge about gravitation (or absence of gravitation); the different forms of energy , including those involving fission and fusion; the whole range of electromagnetic radiation including very high energy gamma rays; we know (in a limited sense) the constituents of the cosmic bodies and the processes going on there, from their electromagnetic spectra that we also see on earth; we can roughly measure their distances and movements from redshifts and luminosity measurements that we know about; we can see the structure of nearby objects with telescopes. </p>
<p>So, in my view, instead of magic carpet rides depending on mathematics and driven by fantasy, we must depend on the cue given in the terrestrial Nature itself and extend them outwards the cosmos to better understand it! The only thing is that these are presented to us at unimaginable scale and scope and also possible new objects and phenomena that are not experienced yet in terrestrial situation. But we have to deal with this limitation and be guided by dialectical intuition obtained from terrestrial life experience so far. There is no sense in being preoccupied with things like so-called “black holes”, dark matter/energy and so on until we can produce a mini “black hole” or “dark matter” particles in machines like the LHC (Large Hadron Collider), for example. </p>
<p>Since epistemology is a reflection of objective reality, there should not be sharp lines of division between the various branches of knowledge. Physics is supposed to be a highly specialised field with various “experts” and specialists, with subdivisions of their own. This, in my view, has given physics the most restricted and disconnected character. Physicists are narrowed down and dispersed in their narrow cells, without a general and organic link with the whole - like the proverbial "frog in the well". The physicist is like a piece of crystalline tobacco mosaic viruses in a bottle, with their perfect symmetry and sharp, well-defined edges and borders - but necessarily lifeless; while they should be in a nutritious environment to acquire creative ability! Only a dialectical approach can remedy this problem in physics.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Natural science began with man gaining mastery over forces of Nature, namely heat, and used that knowledge to change their circumstances in relation to Nature - an endeavour that continues until today. Natural science, therefore, is essentially a practical activity, where thought comes to summarise the essence of this knowledge and develops it through intuition, defining imperative for further endeavour. But powerful thought (such as man creating theories like the Epicycles or General Relativity) gave rise to what Marx called “alienation” - (an Idea, Notion or Theory taking control over man and his action) leading knowledge into a blind alley, groping in the darkness; thereby impeding its development. With Einstein’s theories of relativity, I think we unfortunately are at present in such a state of alienation! </p>
<p>This stems from how many see mathematics. The fact that mathematics is very useful for quantitative sciences, particularly physics and engineering is beyond doubt. The point of contention is whether mathematics is a creation of man and amenable and relevant to his needs as a tool to understand the world and physical Nature and to change it towards desired goals for his benefit, in the materialistic sense. Or if mathematics has a priori existence independent of man to which man and the physical word and Nature must conform to, in the (idealistic) Platonic sense.</p>
<p>I like the radical and more or less revolutionary tune in which Reuben Hersh, who more recently spoke out against Platonism in his book “What Is Mathematics Really?" Where he says, “This book offers a radically different, unconventional answer to that question. Repudiating Platonism, while recognising the reason that make them (alternately) seem plausible. I show that ‘from the viewpoint of philosophy’ mathematics must be understood as a human activity, a social phenomena, part of human culture, historically evolved, and intelligible only in a social context”.</p>
<p>I have argued to demonstrate that modern theoretical physics has abandoned science and has become metaphysics and theology; because it is not dealing with objective reality anymore. Objective reality is full of contradictions, conflicts, chaos, irregularities, deformities, inaccuracies, etc. True perfection, beauty, symmetry etc. is possible only in the realm of thought; through “the mind of theological God”, through logical, geometrical and mathematical categories which allow no contradiction. It is the greatest irony that Newton, who warned physics against metaphysics; himself opened the outpost for metaphysics beyond terrestrial Nature; and later for Einstein to turn it into his “Castle in the Air”; specially after the recognition of the Evil Quanta; where theoretical physicists could take up residence for endless and meaningless scholastic debate in peace; without the nasty contradictions and the ugliness of objective reality.</p>
<p><code>My decade long struggle to free physics from its usurpation by monopoly capitalism making it to preach theology; continues unabated as long as I am capable.</code></p>
<p>Footnote</p>
<p>It is true that our research papers are refused publication, our proposals get ignored, grants refused or terminated, job contracts denied and renewals not considered etc. But we are not totally obscured by all these! The kind soul of one Jean de Climont of France (on a voluntary basis) scans the Internet and compiles a list, known as Editions d'Assailly, in which many of us will find our names listed! There is a recent e-mail notification that this list is coming out in a new format. Hence, we are not totally obscured, discredited and de-legitimized as official physics wants to see us: http://editionsassailly.com/dissidents.htm</p>
<p>These are the words of someone who is either naïve, deliberately blind, a dedicated apologist or is a crude opportunist arguing in an unprincipled way to win an argument a by hook or by a crook. </p>
<p>I take pride in my ability for “iron resilience”, and hope to continue to do so (as far as I can) in support of objective truths in modern natural science and against ideology, mathematics and money fueled myths!</p>
<p>In addition, as a dialectical materialist, I do not accept the criteria of knowledge set and accepted by official physics; even if the theories are mathematically consistent, precisely because I do not accept mathematical idealism and geometric/axiomatic methods as reliable or valid tools for positive knowledge of Nature and objective reality. </p>
<p>So, there is no reason for us to be discouraged, or to give up what we are doing. But (in my opinion) we must not fall into the trap of meaningless and endless mathematical idealism-based scholasticism – a carrot, official physics hangs in front of us, through formal educations, text books, journal article and in the form of sensation making Fairy Tales coming out of the esoteric theories and often peddled in the scientific journals, popular press including in RG. I had to make great efforts during the last three years to keep scholasticism at bay, in this forum, with some limited success. </p>
