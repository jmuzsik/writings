<p>A rational leader suggests changing course to avoid a storm. An irrational one can change the weather. Being slightly bonkers can be a good negotiating strategy: being rational means you are predictable, and being predictable makes you weak. Hillary thinks like an economist, while Donald is a game theorist, and is able to achieve with one tweet what would take Clinton four years of congressional infighting. That’s alchemy; you may hate it, but it works. (Location 343)</p>

<p>Religion feels incompatible with modern life because it seems to involve delusional beliefs, but if the above results came from a trial of a new drug, we would want to add it to tap water. Just because we don’t know why it works, we should not be blind to the fact that it does. (Location 454)</p>

<p>There is a simple reason for this: you can never be fired for being logical. If your reasoning is sound and unimaginative, even if you fail, it is unlikely you will attract much blame. It is much easier to be fired for being illogical than it is for being unimaginative. (Location 588)</p>

<p>Bill Bernbach: ‘Human nature hasn’t changed for a million years. It won’t even change in the next million years. Only the superficial things have changed. It is fashionable to talk about the changing man. A communicator must be concerned with the unchanging man – what compulsions drive him, what instincts dominate his every action, even though his language too often camouflages what really motivates him.’ (Location 690)</p>

<p>Muslims went to great lengths to bury their dead; by contrast, allied bodies often lay on the battlefield for days before they were collected. The outcome was further casualties from disease for the allies, and comparatively lower levels of disease among their opponents. Scientifically unverified beliefs about burial norms drove rational and life-saving behaviour. (Location 1089)</p>
<p>In trying to encourage rational behaviour, don’t confine yourself to rational arguments. (Location 1098)</p>
<p>we do not have to rely solely on rational arguments; if that approach does not work – and often it doesn’t – there is a whole other set of emotional levers we can pull to achieve the same effect. Just ask the 1920s ad industry. (Location 1108)</p>
<p>Consumer behaviour, and advertisers’ attempts to manipulate it, can be viewed as an immense social experiment, with considerable power to reveal the truth about what people want and what drives them. What people do with their own money (their ‘revealed preferences’) is generally a better guide to what they really want than their own reported wants and needs. (Location 1116)</p>

<p>the argumentative hypothesis* suggests reason arose in the human brain not to inform our actions and beliefs, but to explain and defend them to others. In other words, it is an adaptation necessitated by our being a highly social species. (Location 1605)</p>
<p>In this model, reason is not as Descartes thought, the brain’s science and research and development function – it is the brain’s legal and PR department. (Location 1613)</p>

<p>In the words of Jonathan Haidt,* ‘The conscious mind thinks it’s the Oval Office, when in reality it’s the press office.’ By this he means that we believe we are issuing executive orders, while most of the time we are actually engaged in hastily constructing plausible post-rationalisations to explain decisions taken somewhere else, for reasons we do not understand.

<p>Pete Trimmer, a biologist at the University of Bristol, observed that the ability of Siberian hamsters to fight infections varied according to the lighting above their cages – longer hours of light (mimicking summer days) triggered a stronger immune response. Trimmer’s explanation was that the immune system is costly to run, and so as long as an infection is not lethal, it will wait for a signal that fighting it will not endanger the animal in other ways. It seems that the Siberian hamster subconsciously fights infection more energetically in summer because that is when food supplies are sufficiently plentiful to sustain an immune response. Trimmer’s model demonstrated that in challenging environments, animals fared better by weathering infections and conserving resources. Humphrey argues that people subconsciously respond to a sham treatment because it assures us that it will weaken the infection without overburdening the body’s resources. In populations where food is plentiful we can, in theory, mount a full immune response at any time, but Humphrey believes that the subconscious switch has not yet adapted to this – thus it takes a placebo to convince the mind that it is the right time for an immune response.

<p>So, as Humphrey explained, much of the paraphernalia and practice of the military – flags, drums, uniforms, square-bashing, regalia, mascots and so forth – might be effectively bravery placebos, environmental cues designed to foster bravery and solidarity. (Location 2717)</p>

<p>There is a parallel in the behaviour of bees, which do not make the most of the system they have evolved to collect nectar and pollen. Although they have an efficient way of communicating about the direction of reliable food sources, the waggle dance, a significant proportion of the hive seems to ignore it altogether and journeys off at random. In the short term, the hive would be better off if all bees slavishly followed the waggle dance, and for a time this random behaviour baffled scientists, who wondered why 20 million years of bee evolution had not enforced a greater level of behavioural compliance. However, what they discovered was fascinating: without these rogue bees, the hive would get stuck in what complexity theorists call ‘a local maximum’; they would be so efficient at collecting food from known sources that, once these existing sources of food dried up, they wouldn’t know where to go next and the hive would starve to death. So the rogue bees are, in a sense, the hive’s research and development function, and their inefficiency pays off handsomely when they discover a fresh source of food. It is precisely because they do not concentrate exclusively on short-term efficiency that bees have survived so many million years. (Location 3001)</p>

<p>have written this book from an incredibly optimistic perspective, but my argument is not that alchemy is always reliable, ethical or beneficial. Far from it – it is simply that we should not recoil from testing alchemical solutions because they do not fit with our reductionist ideas about how the world works. The purpose of this book is to persuade the reader that alchemy exists whether we like it or not, and that it is possible to use it for good; besides, if people are more aware of its existence, they will be better at spotting its misuses.* (Location 3427)</p>
<p>Alfred Korzybski (1879–1950) is perhaps most famous for his dictum that ‘The map is not the territory.’ He created a field called general semantics, and argued that because human knowledge of the world is limited by human biology, the nervous system and the languages humans have developed, no one can perceive reality, given that everything we know arrived filtered by the brain’s own interpretation of it.

<p>When Kraft wanted to introduce a healthier formulation for their Mac &amp; Cheese, they were terrified of a similar reaction, particularly as the malignant combination of social media and newspapers keen for a story can turn a small number of hostile tweets into national news. So they removed the artificial yellow dye and added paprika, turmeric and other natural replacements – and then kept silent about it. Practically no one noticed a thing – until they announced the change retrospectively, under the headline ‘It’s changed. But it hasn’t.’ This way, they were able to gain the potential custom of people who had previously avoided the product because of its artificiality, without creating an imagined taste change among its regular customers, who suddenly discovered they had been eating the healthier variant all along.* (Location 3485)</p>
