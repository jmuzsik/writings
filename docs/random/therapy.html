<p>CBT vs Psychotherapy: Freud’s here to stay.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cognitive behavioural therapy, focused not on the past but the present; not on mysterious inner drives, but on adjusting the unhelpful thought patterns that cause negative emotions.</li>
<li>painful emotions: primarily something to be eliminated, or failing that, made tolerable</li>
<li>What she needed, she sees now, was real connection: that fundamental if hard-to-express sense of being held in the mind of another person, even if only for a short period each week.</li>
<li>the unconscious is huge, and largely in control; and that we live, unavoidably, through lenses created in the past, which we can only hope to modify partially, slowly and with great effort.</li>
<li>What seems to matter much more is the presence of a compassionate, dedicated therapist, and a patient committed to change; if one therapy is better than all others for all or even most problems, it has yet to be discovered.</li>
<li>Psychoanalysis, after all, embodies just this awed humility about how little we can ever grasp about the workings of our minds. (The one question nobody can ever answer, writes the Jungian analyst James Hollis, is “of what are you unconscious?”) Freud the man scaled heights of arrogance. But his legacy is a reminder that we shouldn’t necessarily expect life to be all that happy, nor to assume we can ever really know what’s going on inside – indeed, that we’re often deeply emotionally invested in preserving our ignorance of unsettling truths.</li>
