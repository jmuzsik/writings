The mind will ever be unstable that has only prejudices to rest on, and the
current will run with destructive fury when there are no barriers to break its
force.
<br />

You shall eat the flesh of your sons, and you shall eat the flesh of your
daughters. I will destroy your high places and cut down your incense altars; I
will heap your carcasses on the carcasses of your idols. I will abhor you. I
will lay your cities waste, will make your sanctuaries desolate, and I will not
smell your pleasing odors. I will devastate the land, so that your enemies who
come to settle in it shall be appalled at it. And you I will scatter among the
nations, and I will unsheathe the sword against you; your land shall be a
desolation, and your cities a waste.
<br />

She who is the most refined and gentle among you, so gentle and refined that she
does not venture to set the sole of her foot on the ground, will begrudge food
to the husband whom she embraces, to her own son, and to her own daughter,
begrudging even the afterbirth that comes out from between her thighs, and the
children that she bears, because she is eating them in secret for lack of
anything else, in the desperate straits to which the enemy siege will reduce you
in your towns.
<br />

Do you not know this from of old, ever since mortals were placed on earth, that
the exulting of the wicked is short, and the joy of the godless is but for a
moment?
