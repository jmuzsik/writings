## the curse of xanadu

'On his long walk home, he came up with the four maxims that have guided his life: most people are fools, most authority is malignant, God does not exist, and everything is wrong'

## a man holding up the his finger: one

'He saw the center of any religion as residing not in books or doctrines, but deep in the heart of each individual. Though his devotion to the teaching of Mohammed was unequivocal, he viewed the inner reaches of Islam, Christianity, Judaism, and Buddhism as merging into one. At times he raised a single index finger, as if this said everything: One. And the prayer beads dangling from his hands were not a cultural ornament or distracting habit. His fingers moved the beads in a continual, silent, circumference.'

## what is therapy

"examining one’s interiority simply a form of narcissism, navel-gazing wrapped in the language of self-improvement?"

## war stories

- Jesse's dad
  - There were what is called snake pits in Vietnam (which were dug wholes that the vietcong dug and filled with spikes so you would fall through to your death)
  - So, each troop of men had several dogs that they would send ahead of them in case there were snake pits (in which case the dogs would fall into it to their death)
  - Now, Jesse's dad was always the type to take care of animals, he loved dogs/etc. so he would constantly form relationships with the dogs and simultaneously they would constantly die by falling through these holes, constantly tearing him apart
- My grandfather
  - My mom tells me that there wherever the troops went they would sleep in fox holes (small holes dug in the ground for them to sleep in, one per man)
  - My grandfather would frequently somehow survive each battle and after would return to these fox holes and pick up any trinkets that may be there (a bottle cap, a piece of linen, etc.) of men who died and hold onto them for the entirety of the war as good luck charms

## work is personal

The resources that managers and businesses are trying to extract from workers are in some ways very personal to the worker

Their imagination, their dynamism, their levels of energy – all these sorts of things.

## ostrich-like disregard

For the past 3500 years of the Western world, the effects of media – whether it's speech, writing, printing, photography, radio or television – have been systematically overlooked by social observers. Even in today's revolutionary electronic age, scholars evidence few signs of modifying this traditional stance of ostrichlike disregard.

## a dream

In red hook (near the lobster spot that I am seeing an apartment at today). I ordered a burger quite hurriedly, receiving it soon afterwards. Then went into the apartment and walked around a bit, there were two sections (modern and normalish looking apartments). Someone came in and I sneakily left. People that were ordering food while I was there were at a park looking spot across the street. I went over there to eat. I wandered through the park.

Noticed this old electric plant that was in someway connected to Jerusalem. I saw apartments next to it with machinery all around them (someway connected to the electric plant) - lots of copper tubes and the like all twisted together. The apartments looked old - sorta like some spots I saw in the Jewish area of Williamsburg. Then I saw these birds float to the floor. I looked closely and they were bats - they looked starving and decrepit - machine-like. I googled or the like (information suddenly came to me) and heard that these bats lived here for countless years. There used to be berries from the trees but most of the trees have died (presumably from the electric plant). Now, they are dying left and right - still mechanically dependent on a food source that is no more.

## relationships

There is no solution. It is about patience. It is about an ability to look one another in the eyes and say this is fine, i accept it, i am willing to continue it if you are. It is about being willing to do that consistently.

## psychedelics

What is a psychedelic experience? It is associated with a very profound disorganization of electric activity in the brain. The brain becomes very much less organized in the way the brain waves perpetuate and work through the brain. We discovered also that the circuits of the brain, some of the circuits in one of the regions of the brain which we knew from other peoples work to be intimately involved in depression were either down regulated or disrupted by psylosybin. … if you disrupt depression causing circuits then maybe you would limit depression and that’s what we found, that’s what we find. We find that psilocybin produces a profound disruption in a network in the brain that encodes self referential thinking… and that’s the network that depressed people get locked up into thinking negative thoughts about themselves, they ruminate about mistakes they’ve made, they have these repetitive self critical appraisals of themselves. We can disrupt that. After coming out of the trip they can reset their mind
