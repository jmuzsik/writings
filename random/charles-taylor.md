The general tendency of this thought was to go for a sempiternal universe, that is, one which underwent change, but in which there was neither beginning nor end. True eternity was beyond this; it was fixed and unvarying.

Without fully abandoning this idea of eternity, Christianity developed a somewhat different one. The Bible sees the universe as made by God. It also tells a story of God’s dealings with humans. This divine-human history is incompatible with the idea that there are ever-repeating cycles. It also means that what happens in time matters. God enters into drama in time. The Incarnation, the Crucifixion happened in time, and so what occurs here can no longer be seen as less than fully real.

Augustine. With him eternity is reconceived as gathered time.

the gathering together of past into present to project a future. The past, which “objectively” exists no more, is here in my present; it shapes this moment in which I turn to a future, which “objectively” is not yet, but which is here qua project.

Now Augustine holds that God can and does make all time such an instant of action. So all times are present to him, and he holds them in his extended simultaneity. His now contains all time. It is a “nunc stans”.

So rising to eternity is rising to participate in God’s instant. Augustine sees ordinary time as dispersal, distensio, losing the unity, being cut off from our past and out of touch with our future. We get lost in our little parcel of time. But we have an irrepressible craving for eternity, and so we strive to go beyond this. Unfortunately, this all too often takes the form of our trying to invest our little parcel with eternal significance, and therefore divinising things, and therefore falling deeper into sin.

The Middle Ages had therefore two models of eternity: what we might call Plato eternity, that of perfect immobility, impassivity, which we aspire to by rising out of time; and God’s eternity, which doesn’t abolish time, but gathers it into an instant. This we can only have access to by participating in God’s life.

we have to add a third kind of higher time, which we can call, following Eliade, a “time of origins”.

The idea is of a Great Time, an “illud tempus”, when the order of things was established, whether that of the creation of the present world, or the founding of our people with its Law.

particular, the disciplines of our modern civilized order have led us to measure and organize time as never before in human history. Time has become a precious resource, not to be “wasted”. The result has been the creation of a tight, ordered time environment. This has enveloped us, until it comes to seem like nature. We have constructed an environment in which we live a uniform, univocal secular time, which we try to measure and control in order to get things done.

We might say that we moved from living in a cosmos to being included in a universe.

But the universe approaches the limitless, or at any rate its limits are not easily encompassable in time or space. Our planet, our solar system is set in a galaxy, which is one of an as yet uncounted number of galaxies. Our origins go back into the mists of evolutionary time, so that we become unclear as to what could count as the beginning of our human story, many of the features of which are irretrievably lost.

We saw this above with Erasmus. As long as the sacrament is used for purposes of good influence, to bring us more into the ambit of grace, that is acceptable. But the focus on a scatter of worldly ends, even though good in themselves, diverts us from true piety. Praying to saints should have as goal purely our own spiritual betterment. “The true way to worship saints is to imitate their virtues, and they care more for this than for a hundred candles . . . You venerate the bones of Paul laid away in a shrine, but not the mind of Paul, enshrined in his writings”.

God could be understood to respond to the prayers of a holy person, but the notion that any old priest, however debauched, can control God’s movements was utterly unacceptable. But then the same goes a fortiori for the manipulation of any charged objects, or for prayer to the Virgin or saints. God is free of his actions. This belongs to his sovereignty.

Christian liberty for Calvin consists in this: that one see salvation in faith; that one serve God with one’s whole heart; and that one no longer be scrupled by indifferent things.85 We can cast aside all the myriad rituals and acts of propitiation of the old religion. Serving God now in our ordinary life, guided by the spirit, we can re-order things freely. We don’t need to be too impressed by custom; this can lead us terribly astray.

As a general proposition, of course, it remains true that the majority of humankind is destined for damnation, and that the minority of the saved are very lucky; but in practice, we are confident that we belong in this minority; and that the universe is unfolding as it should. The declarations that we are helpless sinners become more and more pro forma. I

This is only one facet of the new “police state”, which undertakes to organize the lives of its citizens in rational ways; ensure that they are properly educated, that they belong to churches, that they lead sober and productive economic lives. It is also an organization which effectively combats various social disasters, as plague is controlled by more rigorous quarantine.

It is, as Delumeau argues, an age of anxiety.95 An age of great fears. Fear of magic, of outsiders, of disorders, and of course of sin, death, and judgment. This is particularly marked after the great disasters of the fourteenth century; famines, wars, and above all the Black Death.

The first effect of disenchantment was not to do away with demons, let us remember. Since in the radical form, it eschewed all church magic, it branded all magic as black. Everything of this sort now belonged to the devil, and all sorcerers, cunning women, healers, etc., were now in danger of being branded as confederates of the devil.

The hunt for witches steadily escalated. Heretics were more vigorously hunted down. Fear of vagabonds increased (but here there was objective change also). The hypothesis is that there was more free-floating anxiety, really about one’s own salvation; and so more likelihood that people would react violently to pollution threats to what they dimly saw as bulwarks in the social sacred against whatever menaces arose.

Take the new Aristotelian-Christian synthesis which takes its most influential form in Thomas. This brought about what one could call an autonomization of nature. The things around us have their own natures, the forms which they strive to embody, and hence their own kind of perfection. They are also called to exhibit another kind of perfection in the dimension of grace, but this doesn’t cancel or set aside their inherent, natural perfection.

The interesting question is, what goal(s) was (were) hegemonic; what explains the original shift to autonomy, among those who made it? what explains its continuing impact? what meanings are defined as the proper or highest ones?

(The entire sense-perceptible world is like a sort of book written by the finger of God.)
