Breaking Smart

Marshall McLuhan’s observation that “the medium is the message”. (Location 22)

People change, then forget that they changed, and act as though they always behaved a certain way and could never change again. (Location 25)

To “break smart” is to adapt intelligently to new technological possibilities. (Location 32)

After written language and money, software is only the third major soft technology to appear in human civilization. (Location 37)

Only a handful of general-purpose technologies1 – electricity, steam power, precision clocks, written language, token currencies, iron metallurgy and agriculture among them – have impacted our world in the sort of deeply transformative way that deserves the description eating. And only two of these, written language and money, were soft technologies: seemingly ephemeral, but capable of being embodied in a variety of specific physical forms. (Location 41)

As a simple example, a 14-year-old teenager today (too young to show up in labor statistics) can learn programming, contribute significantly to open-source projects, and become a talented professional-grade programmer before age 18. This is breaking smart: an economic actor using early mastery of emerging technological leverage — in this case a young individual using software leverage — to wield disproportionate influence on the emerging future. (Location 53)

One result of this increased potential was that technologists began to grope towards a collective vision commonly called the Internet of Things. It is a vision based on the prospect of processors becoming so cheap, miniaturized and low-powered that they can be embedded, along with power sources, sensors and actuators, in just about anything, from cars and light bulbs to clothing and pills. Estimates of the economic potential of the Internet of Things – of putting a chip and software into every physical item on Earth – vary from $2.7 trillion to over $14 trillion: (Location 74)

To traditionalists, particularly in the United States, the car is a motif for an entire way of life, and the smartphone just an accessory. To early adopters who have integrated ridesharing deeply into their lives, the smartphone is the lifestyle motif, and the car is the accessory. To generations of Americans, owning a car represented freedom. To the next generation, not owning a car will represent freedom. (Location 94)

Software-fueled victories in the past decade have tended to be overwhelming and irreversible faits accompli. And this appears to be true at all levels from individuals to businesses to nations. Even totalitarian dictatorships seem unable to resist the transformation indefinitely. (Location 110)

So to understand how software is eating the world, we have to ask why we have been systematically underestimating its impact, and how we can recalibrate our expectations for the future. (Location 112)

as futurist Roy Amara noted, “We tend to overestimate the effect of a technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the long run.” (Location 135)

The railroad revolution of the nineteenth century also saw a transitional period marked by systematically flawed expectations, a bloody civil war in the United States, and extensive patterns of disguised change — such as the rise of urban living, grocery store chains, and meat consumption — whose root cause was cheap rail transport. (Location 155)

The fourth reason we underestimate software, however, is a unique one: it is a revolution that is being led, in large measure, by brash young kids rather than sober adults. (Location 157)

Within the current structure of the global economy, older generations can, and do, borrow unconditionally from the future at the expense of the young and the yet-to-be-born. (Location 162)

Instead of vying for control of venerable institutions that have already weathered several generational wars, young people are creating new institutions based on the new software and new wealth. These improvised but highly effective institutions repeatedly emerge out of nowhere, and begin accumulating political and economic power. (Location 167)

Yet, today’s youth culture is arguably more powerful as a result, representing as it does what Jane Jacobs called the “commerce syndrome” of values, rooted in pluralistic economic pragmatism, rather than the opposed “guardian syndrome” of values, rooted in exclusionary and authoritarian political ideologies. (Location 173)

what the smartest people do on the weekend is what everyone else will do during the week in ten years. (Location 177)

It is important to note though, that this social order based on credentialism and paperware worked reasonably well for almost a century between approximately 1870 and 1970, and created a great deal of new wealth and prosperity. Despite its stifling effects on individualism, creativity and risk-taking, it offered its members a broader range of opportunities and more security than the narrow agrarian provincialism it supplanted. For all its shortcomings, lifetime employment in a large corporation like General Motors, with significantly higher standards of living, was a great improvement over pre-industrial rural life. (Location 189)

The legend of Prometheus has been used as a metaphor for technological progress (Location 204)

As a result of a Promethean technology being unleashed, younger and older face a similar dilemma: should I abandon some of my investments in the industrial social order and join the dynamic new social order, or hold on to the status quo as long as possible? (Location 211)

Those with a Promethean mindset and an aggressive approach to pursuing a new path can break out of the credentialist life script at any age. (Location 217)

How and why you should choose the Promethean option, despite its disorienting uncertainties and challenges, is the overarching theme of Season 1. It is a choice we call breaking smart, (Location 221)

See for example, the phenomenon of hyperbolic discounting, one of the major biases that affect human temporal reasoning. (Location 229)

The bigger risk is getting attached to a particular what and when, a specific vision of a paradise to be sought, preserved or reclaimed. This is often a serious philosophical error — to which pastoralist mindsets are particularly prone — that seeks to limit the future. (Location 258)

One piece of wisdom in Silicon Valley today is that the core of the best software is nearly always written by teams of fewer than a dozen people, not by huge committee-driven development teams. This means increasing well-being for all will be achieved through small two-pizza teams beating large ones. (Location 271)

we get a picture of messy, emergent progress that economist Bradford Delong calls “slouching towards utopia“: a condition of gradual, increasing quality of life available, at gradually declining cost, to a gradually expanding portion of the global population. A big implication is immediately clear: the asymptotic condition represents a consumer utopia. (Location 282)

Work will take on an experimental, trial-and-error character, and will take place in an environment of rich feedback, self-correction, adaptation, ongoing improvement, and continuous learning. (Location 291)

the hacker ethos will go global and the workforce at large will break smart. As the hacker ethos spreads, we will witness what economist Edmund Phelps calls a mass flourishing2 — a state of the economy where work will be challenging and therefore fulfilling. (Location 294)

If this vision seems overly dramatic, consider once again the comparison to other soft technologies: software is perhaps the most imagination-expanding technology humans have invented since writing and money, and possibly more powerful than either. To operate on the assumption that it will transform the world at least as dramatically, far from being wild-eyed optimism, is sober realism. (Location 300)

Edmund Phelps’ Mass Flourishing (2014) is a magisterial survey of the rise of corporatism and its stifling effects on the economic dynamism that marked the early decades of the industrial revolution. By critically examining a wide variety of economic indicators (ranging from job satisfaction and values surveys to employment and growth data), Phelps constructs a powerful case for abandoning corporatist economic organization models. (Location 307)

This oft-quoted section illustrates its basic spirit: In many ways, the IETF runs on the beliefs of its members. One of the “founding beliefs” is embodied in an early quote about the IETF from David Clark: “We reject kings, presidents and voting. We believe in rough consensus and running code”. Another early quote that has become a commonly-held belief in the IETF comes from Jon Postel: “Be conservative in what you send and liberal in what you accept”. (Location 368)

I will argue that this pattern of development is not limited to computer science. Every field eaten by software experiences a migration of the creative part from visioning activities to hands-on activities, disrupting the social structure of all professions. Classical engineering fields like mechanical, civil and electrical engineering had already largely succumbed to hands-on pragmatic hacking by the nineties. Non-engineering fields like marketing are beginning to convert. (Location 379)

These failure patterns are characteristic of what political scientist James Scott1 called authoritarian high modernism: a purist architectural aesthetic driven by the authoritarian priorities. To authoritarian high-modernists, elements of the environment that do not conform to their purist design visions appear “illegible” and anxiety-provoking. As a result, they attempt to make the environment legible by forcibly removing illegible elements. (Location 405)
Updated: Sep 14, 2020

In short, authoritarian high modernism is a kind of tunnel vision. Architects are prone to it in environments that are richer than one mind can comprehend. The urge to dictate and organize is destructive, because it leads architects to destroy the apparent chaos that is vital for success. (Location 416)

innovation, which by definition is driven by ideas that are illegible to all but a few: what Peter Thiel calls secrets — things entrepreneurs believe that nobody else does, which leads them to unpredictable breakthroughs. (Location 428)

Fortunately, agile software development manages to combine both decisive authority and pluralistic visions, and mitigate risks without slowing things to a crawl. The basic principles of agile development, articulated by a group of 17 programmers in 2001, in a document known as the Agile Manifesto, (Location 438)

The cost of this agility is a seemingly anarchic pattern of progress. Agile development models catalyze illegible, collective patterns of creativity, weaken illusions of control, and resist being yoked to driving utopian visions. Adopting agile models leads individuals and organizations to gradually increase their tolerance for anxiety in the face of apparent chaos. As a result, agile models can get more agile over time. (Location 441)

Once a field becomes hacker-friendly, software begins to eat it. (Location 448)

The IETF slogan of rough consensus and running code (RCRC) has emerged as the only workable doctrine for both technological development and associated economic models under these conditions. (Location 459)

As a result of pragmatism prevailing, a nearly ungovernable Promethean fire has been unleashed. Hundreds of thousands of software entrepreneurs are unleashing innovations on an unsuspecting world by the power vested in them by “nobody in particular,” and by any economic means necessary. (Location 461)

Software possesses an extremely strange property: it is possible to create high-value software products with effectively zero capital outlay. As Mozilla engineer Sam Penrose put it, software programming is labor that creates capital. (Location 468)

It is something of a stretch to even think of software as a kind of engineering “material.” Though all computing requires a physical substrate, the trillions of tiny electrical charges within computer circuits, the physical embodiment of a running program, barely seem like matter. (Location 472)

Paper almost qualifies as a medium for true creative abundance, but falls just short. (Location 476)

Software though, is a medium that not only can, but must be approached with an abundance mindset. Without a level of extensive trial-and-error and apparent waste that would bankrupt both traditional engineering and art, good software does not take shape. (Location 477)

Purist visions tend to arise when authoritarian architects attempt to concentrate and use scarce resources optimally, in ways they often sincerely believe is best for all. (Location 486)

By contrast, tinkering is focused on steady progress rather than optimal end-states that realize a totalizing vision. It is usually driven by individual interests and not obsessively concerned with grand and paternalistic “best for all” objectives. The result is that purist visions seem more comforting and aesthetically appealing on the outside, while pragmatic hacking looks messy and unfocused. At the same time purist visions are much less open to new possibilities and bricolage, while pragmatic hacking is highly open to both. Within (Location 487)

With Moore’s Law kicking in, pioneering computer scientist Alan Kay codified the idea of abundance orientation with the observation that programmers ought to “waste transistors” in order to truly unleash the power of computing. (Location 492)

Paradoxically, the IETF philosophy of eschewing “kings, presidents and voting” means that rough consensus evolves through strong-minded individuals either truly coming to an agreement, or splitting off to pursue their own dissenting ideas. Conflicts are not sorted out through compromises that leave everybody unhappy. Instead they are sorted out through the principle futurist Bob Sutton identified as critical for navigating uncertainty: strong views, weakly held. (Location 506)

Rough consensus favors people who, in traditional organizations, would be considered disruptive and stubborn: these are exactly the people prone to “breaking smart.” In its most powerful form, rough consensus is about finding the most fertile directions in which to proceed rather than uncovering constraints. (Location 512)

This general principle of fertility-seeking has been repeatedly rediscovered and articulated in a bewildering variety of specific forms. The statements have names such as the principle of least commitment (planning software), the end-to-end principle (network design), the procrastination principle (architecture), optionality (investing), paving the cowpaths (interface design), lazy evaluation (language design) and late binding (code execution). While the details, assumptions and scope of applicability of these different statements vary, they all amount to leaving the future as free and unconstrained as possible, by making as few commitments as possible in any given local context. (Location 518)

The principle is in fact an expression of laissez-faire engineering ethics. Donald Knuth, another software pioneer, captured the ethical dimension with his version: premature optimization is the root of all evil. (Location 523)

Behaviors that would be short-sighted in the context of scarcity become far-sighted in the context of abundance. (Location 529)

Traditional processes of consensus-seeking drive towards clarity in long-term visions but are usually fuzzy on immediate next steps. By contrast, rough consensus in software deliberately seeks ambiguity in long-term outcomes and extreme clarity in immediate next steps. It is a heuristic that helps correct the cognitive bias behind Amara’s Law. Clarity in next steps counteracts the tendency to overestimate what is possible in the short term, while comfort with ambiguity in visions counteracts the tendency to underestimate what is possible in the long term. At an ethical level, rough consensus is deeply anti-authoritarian, since it avoids constraining the freedoms of future stakeholders simply to allay present anxieties. (Location 534)

true north in software is often the direction that combines ambiguity and evidence of fertility in the most alluring way: the direction of maximal interestingness.3 (Location 540)

The term pivot, introduced by Eric Ries as part of the Lean Startup framework, has recently gained popularity for such reorientation. A pivot allows the direction of development to change rapidly, without a detailed long-term plan. It is enough to figure out experimental next steps. This ability to reorient and adopt new mental models quickly (what military strategists call a fast transient4) is at the heart of agility. (Location 547)

One that is very different from the authoritarian high-modernist way, or as it is known in software engineering, the waterfall model (named for the way high-level purist plans flow unidirectionally towards low-level implementation work). (Location 557)

The biggest consequence is this: in the waterfall model, execution usually lags vision, leading to a deficit-driven process. By contrast, in working agile processes, running code races ahead, leaving vision to catch up, creating a surplus-driven process. (Location 563)

The deficit in the case of waterfall models is the source of what William Boyd called zemblanity: “unpleasant unsurprises.” (Location 566)

Agile processes on the other hand, can lead to snowballing serendipity, getting luckier and luckier, and succeeding in unexpected ways. The (Location 568)

The engineering term for the serendipitous, empowering gap between running code and governing vision has now made it into popular culture in the form of a much-misunderstood idea: perpetual beta. (Location 570)

See the essay by Paul Graham, Hackers and Painters. (Location 572)

Fast transient is a term of art in a military doctrine known as maneuver warfare. Maneuver warfare is descended from a long tradition dating back to Sun Tzu’s Art of War and the German Blitzkrieg model in World War II. (Location 579)

In its contemporary form, it was developed by Col. John Boyd of the US Air Force. The Lean Startup movement is in many ways a simplified version of a core concept in Boydian maneuver warfare: the OODA loop (Observe, Orient, Decide and Act). The Lean Startup notion of pivot corresponds roughly to the idea of a rapid reorientation via a fast transient. A good discussion of the application of maneuver warfare concepts for business environments can be found in Chet Richards’ excellent book, Certain to Win (Location 581)

For technologists interested in learning agile methodologies, there are many excellent books, such as The Principles of Product Development Flow: Second Generation Lean Product Development (Location 586)

The best products use perpetual beta as a way to lead their users towards richer, more empowered behaviors, instead of following them through customer-driven processes. (Location 600)

The answer is that it doesn’t get finished. But unlike in waterfall models, this does not necessarily mean the product is incomplete. It means the vision is perpetually incomplete and growing in unbounded ways, due to ongoing evolutionary experiments. When this process works well, what engineers call technical debt can get transformed into what we might call technical surplus.3 The parts of the product that lack satisfying design justifications represent the areas of rapid innovation. The gaps in the vision are sources of serendipitous good luck. (Location 604)

Just as rough consensus drives ideation towards “maximal interestingness”, agile processes drive evolution towards the regimes of greatest operational uncertainty, where failures are most likely to occur. In well-run modern software processes, not only is the resulting chaos tolerated, it is actively invited (Location 617)

Conditions that cause failure, instead of being cordoned off for avoidance in the future, are deliberately and systematically recreated and explored further. (Location 621)

The origins of this curious philosophy lie in what is known as the release early, release often (RERO) principle, usually attributed to Linus Torvalds, the primary architect of the Linux operating system. The idea is exactly what it sounds like: releasing code as early as possible, and as frequently as possible while it is actively evolving. (Location 626)

As a result, it is usually faster and cheaper to learn from failure than to attempt to anticipate and accommodate it via detailed planning (which is why the RERO principle is often restated in terms of failure as fail fast). (Location 630)

Due to their roots in scarcity, lean models at best mitigate the problems caused by waterfall thinking. Truly agile models on the other hand, do more: they catalyze abundance. (Location 637)

Failed experiments can be abandoned earlier, with lower sunk costs. Successful ones can migrate into the product as fast as hidden risks can be squeezed out. As a result, a lightweight sense of direction — rough consensus — is enough. There is no need to navigate by an increasingly unattainable utopian vision. (Location 643)

Technical debt, a notion introduced by Ward Cunningham (the inventor of the Wiki) in 1992, is conceptually similar to debt in the economic sense. It usually refers to known pending work, such as replacing temporary expedient hacks with ideal solutions, and “refactoring” to improve inefficiently structured code. The “debt” is the gap between the idealized version of the feature and the one actually in place. (Location 649)

In the context of agile processes, however, all such debt, created through either expedience or incompleteness, is not necessarily “must do” work. If an experimental feature is not actually adopted by users, or rendered unnecessary by a pivot, there may be no point in replacing an expedient solution with an idealized one. Technical surplus can analogously be thought of as the unanticipated growth opportunities (or optionality in the sense of Nassim Taleb in Antifragile) created by users doing creative and unexpected things with existing features. Such opportunities require an expansion in the vision. The surplus comprises the spillover value of unanticipated uses. (Location 654)

in economics, a project with high technical debt is in a fragile state and vulnerable to zemblanity. A project with high technical surplus is in an antifragile state and open to serendipity. (Location 658)

Where democratic processes would lead to gridlock and stalled development, conflicts under rough consensus and running code and release early, release often processes leads to competing, divergent paths of development that explore many possible worlds in parallel. (Location 668)

Software that thrives in such environments has a peculiar characteristic: what computer scientist Richard Gabriel described as worse is better.2 Working code that prioritizes visible simplicity, catalyzing effective collaboration and rapid experimentation, tends to spread rapidly and unpredictably. Overwrought code that prioritizes authoritarian, purist concerns such as formal correctness, consistency, and completeness tends to die out. (Location 685)

can feel like mounting zemblanity: a sense of inevitable doom. (Location 724)

Every aggressively growing startup seems like a special-forces team with an occupying army of job-eating machine-learning programs and robots following close behind. (Location 725)

is understandable that to people in the traditional economy, software eating the world sounds like a relentless war between technology and humanity. (Location 729)

But concerns that the game might end should not lead us to limit ourselves to what philosopher James Carse6 called finite game views of the world, based on “winning” and arriving at a changeless, pure and utopian state as a prize. (Location 739)

As we will argue in the next essay, the appropriate mindset is what Carse called an infinite game view, based on the desire to continue playing the game in increasingly generative ways. From an infinite game perspective, software eating the world is in fact the best thing that can happen to the world. (Location 741)

the notion of exit in Albert O. Hirschman’s well-known model of dissent as an exit-versus-voice choice. One way to understand the nature of software is that it favors exit over voice as a means of expressing dissent. Beyond code-sharing, this has led, for instance, to the popularity of the law of two feet at informal unconferences in technology, where the social norm is leave talks and sessions that you are not interested in, rather than staying merely to be polite to the speaker. (Location 744)

Prometheanism is the philosophy of technology that follows from the idea that humans can, do and should change. Pastoralism, on the other hand is the philosophy that change is profane. (Location 778)

Science fiction writer Douglas Adams reduced the phenomenon to a set of three sardonic rules from the point of view of users of technology: Anything that is in the world when you’re born is normal and ordinary and is just a natural part of the way the world works. Anything that’s invented between when you’re fifteen and thirty-five is new and exciting and revolutionary and you can probably get a career in it. Anything invented after you’re thirty-five is against the natural order of things. (Location 782)

As the Industrial Revolution began, workers naturally worried about being displaced by increasingly efficient machines. But the Luddites themselves “were totally fine with machines,” says Kevin Binfield, editor of the 2004 collection Writings of the Luddites. They confined their attacks to manufacturers who used machines in what they called “a fraudulent and deceitful manner” to get around standard labor practices. “They just wanted machines that made high-quality goods,” says Binfield, “and they wanted these machines to be run by workers who had gone through an apprenticeship and got paid decent wages. Those were their only concerns.3 (Location 804)

In his essay, Conniff argues that the original Luddites were simply fighting to preserve their idea of human values, and concludes that “standing up against technologies that put money or convenience above other human values” is necessary for a critical engagement of technology. (Location 809)

Such snowballing changes in patterns of life are due to what economists call consumer surplus5 (increased spending power elsewhere due to falling costs in one area of consumption) and positive spillover effects6 (unexpected benefits in unrelated industries or distant geographies). (Location 834)

Technology publishing pioneer Tim O’Reilly captured the essence of this phenomenon with the principle, “create more value than you capture.” For the highest-impact products, the societal value created dwarfs the value captured. (Location 845)

in the decades immediately following the expiration of James Watt’s patents. Once an invention leaks into what Robert Allen calls “collective invention settings,” with a large number of individuals and firms freely sharing information and independently tinkering with an innovation, future evolution gathers unstoppable momentum and the innovation goes from “weird” to “new normal.” Besides the Cornish mining district in the early 1800s, the Connecticut Valley in the 1870s-1890s,9 Silicon Valley since 1950 and the Shenzen region of China since the 1990s are examples of flourishing collective invention settings. Together, such active creative regions constitute the global technology frontier: the worldwide zone of bricolage. (Location 855)

As consumers, we experience this kind of evolution as what Buckminster Fuller called ephemeralization: the seemingly magical ability of technology to do more and more with less and less. (Location 864)

The result is a virtuous cycle of increasing serendipity, driven by widespread lifestyle adaptation and cascades of self-improving innovation. Surplus and spillover creating more surplus and spillover. Brad deLong’s slouching towards utopia for consumers and Edmund Phelps’ mass flourishing for producers. And when the virtuous cycle is powered by a soft, world-eating technology, the steady, cumulative impact is immense. (Location 870)

Just as pragmatic and purist development models lead to serendipity and zemblanity in engineering respectively, Promethean and pastoral models lead to serendipity and zemblanity at the level of entire societies. (Location 888)

When pastoralist calls for actual retreat are heeded, the technological frontier migrates elsewhere, often causing centuries of stagnation. This was precisely what happened in China and the Islamic world around the fifteenth century, when the technological frontier shifted to Europe. (Location 889)

“First they ignore you. Then they ridicule you. And then they attack you and want to burn you. And then they build monuments to you.” (Location 903)

Spillover is, loosely, the benefits in one sector due to unrelated causes in another sector. The term is also used to refer to such benefits spreading across national borders. (Location 918)

The notion of a pastoral is useful for understanding idealized understandings of any society, real or imagined, past, present or future. In Philip Roth’s American Pastoral for instance, the term is an allusion to the idealized American lifestyle enjoyed by the protagonist Seymour “Swede” Levov, before it is ruined by the social turmoil of the 1960s. (Location 934)

The World Fairs pastoral, for instance, emerged out of a Promethean period in the United States, heralded by Alexander Hamilton in the 1790s. Hamilton recognized the enormous potential of industrial manufacturing, and in his influential 1792 Report on Manufactures,4 argued that the then-young United States ought to strive to become a manufacturing superpower. For much of the nineteenth century, Hamilton’s ideas competed for political influence5 with Thomas Jefferson’s pastoral vision of an agrarian, small-town way of life, a romanticized, sanitized version of the society that already existed. (Location 969)

For almost 60 years, it was in fact Jefferson’s parochial sense of proportions that dominated American politics. It was not until the Civil War that the contradictions inherent in the Jeffersonian pastoral led to its collapse as a political force. Today, while it still supplies powerful symbolism to politicians’ speeches, all that remains of the Jeffersonian Pastoral is a nostalgic cultural memory of small-town agrarian life. (Location 976)

During the same period, Hamilton’s ideas, through their overwhelming success, evolved from a vague sense of direction in the 1790s into a rapidly maturing industrial social order by the 1890s. (Location 979)

When pastoral fantasies start to collapse under the weight of their own internal contradictions, long-repressed energies are unleashed. The result is a societal condition marked by widespread lifestyle experimentation based on previously repressed values. (Location 992)

From the Greek philosopher Plato1 (who lamented the invention of writing in the 4th century BC) to the Chinese scholar, Zhang Xian Wu2 (who lamented the invention of printing in the 12th century AD), alarmist commentary on technological change has been a constant in history. (Location 1011)

This is the idea that technology-driven unemployment is a real concern, an idea that arises from the more basic assumption that there is a fixed amount of work (“lump of labor”) to be done. By this logic, if a machine does more, then there is less for people to do. (Location 1022)

Joseph Tainter observes in The Collapse of Complex Societies: Values of course, vary culturally, socially and individually…What one individual, society, or culture values highly another does not…Most of us approve, in general, of that which culturally is most like or most pleasing, or at least most intelligible to us. The result is a global bedlam of idiosyncratic ideologies, each claiming exclusive possession of ‘truth.’… The ‘decadance’ concept seems particularly detrimental [and is] notoriously difficult to define. Decadent behavior is that which differs from one’s own moral code, particular if the offender at some former time behaved in a manner of which one approves. There is no clear causal link between the morality of behavior and political fortunes. (Location 1053)

But, as Steiner notes: I do not think it will work. On the most brutal, empirical level, we have no example in history…of a complex economic and technological system backtracking to a more simple, primitive level of survival. Yes, it can be done individually. We all, I think, in the universities now have a former colleague or student somewhere planting his own organic food, living in a cabin in the forest, trying to educate his family far from school. Individually it might work. Socially, I think, it is moonshine. (Location 1063)

Prometheans understand technological evolution in terms of increasing diversity of lived values, in the form of more varied actual lifestyles. From any given pastoral perspective, such increasing pluralism is a sign of moral decline, but from a Promethean perspective, it is a sign of moral progress catalyzed by new technological capabilities. (Location 1077)

This does not mean that lived values must be uncritically accepted or left unexamined. It just means that lived values must be judged on their own merit, rather than through the lens of a prejudiced pastoral vision. (Location 1085)

New lived values and new technologies simultaneously irrupt into society in the form of new lifestyles. Old lifestyles do not necessarily vanish: there are still Jeffersonian small farmers and traditional blacksmiths around the world for instance. Rather, they occupy a gradually diminishing role in the social order. As a result, new and old technologies and an increasing number of value systems coexist. In other words, human pluralism eventually expands to accommodate the full potential of technological capabilities. (Location 1098)

We call this the principle of generative pluralism. Generative pluralism is what allows the virtuous cycle of surplus and spillover to operate. Ephemeralization — the ability to gradually do more with less — creates room for the pluralistic expansion of lifestyle possibilities and individual values, without constraining the future to a specific path. (Location 1102)

Thanks to a particularly fertile kind of generative pluralism that we know as network effects, soft technologies like language and money have historically caused the greatest broad increases in complexity and pluralism. When more people speak a language or accept a currency, the potential of that language or currency increases in a non-zero-sum way. Shared languages and currencies allow more people to harmoniously co-exist, despite conflicting values, by allowing disputes to be settled through words or trade4 rather than violence. We should therefore expect software eating the world to cause an explosion in the variety of possible lifestyles, and society as a whole becoming vastly more pluralistic. (Location 1107)

Power, unlike capability, is zero-sum, since it is defined in terms of control over other human beings. Generative pluralism implies that on average, pastoralists are constantly ceding power to Prometheans. In the long term, however, the loss of power is primarily a psychological rather than material loss. (Location 1124)

The broader lesson of the principle of generative pluralism is this: through technology, societies become intellectually capable of handling progressively more complex value-based conflicts. As societies gradually awaken to resolution mechanisms that do not require authoritarian control over the lives of others, they gradually substitute intelligence and information for power and coercion.

Innovation can in fact be defined as ongoing moral progress achieved by driving directly towards the regimes of greatest moral ambiguity, where our collective demons lurk. (Location 1157)

The subjective psychological feel of this evolutionary process is what Marshall McLuhan described in terms of a rear-view mirror effect: “we see the world through a rear-view mirror. We march backwards into the future.” (Location 1159)

Today, our collective rear-view mirror is packed with seeming profanity, in the form of multiple paths of descent into hell. Among the major ones that occupy our minds are the following: Technological Unemployment: The debate around technological unemployment and the concern that “this time it is different” with AI and robots “eating all the jobs.” Inequality: The rising concern around persistent inequality and the fear that software, unlike previous technologies, does not offer much opportunity outside of an emerging intellectual elite of programmers and financiers. “Real” Problems: The idea that “real” problems such as climate change, collapsing biodiversity, healthcare, water scarcity and energy security are being neglected, while talent and energy are being frivolously expended on “trivial” photo-sharing apps. “Real” Innovation: The idea that “real” innovation in areas such as space exploration, flying cars and jetpacks has stagnated. National Competitiveness: The idea that software eating the world threatens national competitiveness based on manufacturing prowess and student performance on standardized tests. Cultural Decline: The idea that social networks, and seemingly “low-quality” new media and online education are destroying intellectual culture. Cybersecurity: The concern that vast new powers of repression are being gained by authoritarian forces, threatening freedom everywhere: Surveillance and cyberwarfare technologies (the latter ranging from worms like Stuxnet created by intelligence agencies, to drone strikes) beyond the reach of average citizens. The End of the Internet: The concern that new developments due to commercial interests pose a deep and existential threat to the freedoms and possibilities that we have come to associate with the Internet. (Location 1166)

Dickens’ memorable opening paragraph in A Tale of Two Cities captures this state of confused urgency and inchoate anxiety perfectly: It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way – in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only. (Location 1181)

In other words, our basic answer to the non-question of “inequality, surveillance and everything” is this: the best way through it is through it. It is an answer similar in spirit to the stoic principle that “the obstacle is the way” and the Finnish concept of sisu: meeting adversity head-on by cultivating a capacity for managing stress, rather than figuring out schemes to get around it.

What is new about this specific form is that it is much more than a metaphor. The view of the world as a single, connected, substrate for computation is not just a poetic way to appreciate the world: It is a way to shape it and act upon it. (Location 1237)

There are two major subplots to this story. The first subplot is about bits dominating atoms. The second subplot is about the rise of a new culture of problem-solving. (Location 1271)

Neal Stephenson’s essay on the world of cable-laying, Mother Earth, Mother Board, is still a must-read, almost 20 years later. His idea of “hacker tourism” is something everybody should try as part of becoming technologically literate. (Location 1272)

In other words, we don’t just live on a networked planet. We live on a planet networked by software, a distinction that makes all the difference. The software-networked planet is an entity that can exist in a continuous and coherent way despite continuous hardware churn, just as we humans experience a persistent identity, even though almost every atom in our bodies gets swapped out every few years. (Location 1311)

This is a profound development. We are used to thinking of atoms as enduring and bits as transient and ephemeral, but in fact the reverse is more true today. (Location 1313)

By contrast it is challenging to preserve old hard technologies even in museums, let alone in working order as functional elements of society. When software eats hardware, however, we can physically or virtually recreate hardware as necessary, imbuing transient atoms with the permanence of bits. (Location 1318)

Software can preserve the past in the form of detailed, relivable memories that go far beyond the written word. (Location 1335)

When software eats history this way, as it is happening, the ability to forget10 becomes a more important political, economic and cultural concern than the ability to remember. (Location 1350)

When bits begin to dominate atoms, it no longer makes sense to think of virtual and physical worlds as separate, detached spheres of human existence. It no longer makes sense to think of machine and human spheres as distinct non-social and social spaces. When software eats the world, “social media,” including both human and machine elements, becomes the entire Internet. “The Internet” in turn becomes the entire world. And in this fusion of digital and physical, it is the digital that dominates. (Location 1352)

The fallacious idea that the online world is separate from and subservient to the offline world (an idea called digital dualism, (Location 1355)

When the value of a physical resource is a function of how openly and intelligently it can be shared and used in conjunction with software, it becomes less contentious. In a world organized by atoms-over-bits logic, most resources are by definition what economists call rivalrous: if I have it, you don’t. Such captive resources are limited by the imagination and goals of one party. (Location 1366)

When software eats the economy, the so-called “sharing economy” becomes the entire economy, and renting, rather than ownership, becomes the default logic driving consumption. (Location 1371)

As sociologist Bruno Latour has argued, “social” is now about more than the human. It includes ideas and objects flexibly networked through software. Instead of being an externally injected alien element, technology and innovation become part of the definition of what it means to be social. (Location 1373)

This is the second major subplot in our Tale of Two Computers. Wherever bits begin to dominate atoms, we solve problems differently. Instead of defining and pursuing goals we create and exploit luck. (Location 1379)

The EU and Argentina, for instance, have right to be forgotten laws. (Location 1398)

The difference between the two is simple: the geographic world solves problems in goal-driven ways, through literal or metaphoric zero-sum territorial conflict. The networked world solves them in serendipitous ways, through innovations that break assumptions about how resources can be used, typically making them less rivalrous and unexpectedly abundant. (Location 1403)

Goal-driven problem-solving follows naturally from the politician’s syllogism: we must do something; this is something; we must do this. (Location 1406)

At its simplest, the process looks roughly like this: Problem selection: Choose a clear and important problem Resourcing: Capture resources by promising to solve it Solution: Solve the problem within promised constraints This model is so familiar that it seems tautologically equivalent to “problem solving”. (Location 1409)

Choosing a problem based on “importance” means uncritically accepting pastoral problem frames and priorities. Constraining the solution with an alluring “vision” of success means limiting creative possibilities for those who come later. Innovation is severely limited: You cannot act on unexpected ideas that solve different problems with the given resources, let alone pursue the direction of maximal interestingness indefinitely. This means unseen opportunity costs can be higher than visible benefits. You also cannot easily pursue solutions that require different (and possibly much cheaper) resources than the ones you competed for: problems must be solved in pre-approved ways. (Location 1416)

The networked world approach is based on a very different idea. It does not begin with utopian goals or resources captured through specific promises or threats. Instead it begins with open-ended, pragmatic tinkering that thrives on the unexpected. The process is not even recognizable as a problem-solving mechanism at first glance: Immersion in relevant streams of ideas, people and free capabilities Experimentation to uncover new possibilities through trial and error Leverage to double down on whatever works unexpectedly well Where the politician’s syllogism focuses on repairing things that look broken in relation to an ideal of changeless perfection, the tinkerer’s way focuses on possibilities for deliberate change. (Location 1425)

Scott Adams observed, “Normal people don’t understand this concept; they believe that if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. Engineers believe that if it ain’t broke, it doesn’t have enough features yet.”2 (Location 1431)

This is the key difference between the two problem-solving processes: in goal-driven problem-solving, open-ended ideation is fundamentally viewed as a negative. In tinkering, it is a positive. (Location 1434)

sensitized to developing opportunities and threats. The perpetual experimentation, as we saw in previous essays, feeds via bricolage on whatever is available. Often these are resources considered “waste” by neighboring goal-directed processes: a case of social costs being turned into assets. A great deal of modern data science for instance, begins with “data exhaust”: data of no immediate goal-directed use to an organization that would normally get discarded in an environment of high storage costs. (Location 1437)

Tinkerers — be they individuals or organizations — in possession of valuable but under-utilized resources tend to do something counter-intuitive. Instead of keeping idle resources captive, they open up access to as many people as possible, with as few strings attached as possible, in the hope of catalyzing spillover tinkering. (Location 1442)

Tinkering is a process of serendipity-seeking that does not just tolerate uncertainty and ambiguity, it requires it. When conditions for it are right, the result is a snowballing effect where pleasant surprises lead to more pleasant surprises. (Location 1448)

What makes this a problem-solving mechanism is diversity of individual perspectives coupled with the law of large numbers (the statistical idea that rare events can become highly probable if there are enough trials going on). If an increasing number of highly diverse individuals operate this way, the chances of any given problem getting solved via a serendipitous new idea slowly rises. This is the luck of networks. (Location 1450)

This makes Silicon Valley the first economic culture to fully and consciously embrace the natural logic of networks. When the process works well, resources flow naturally towards whatever effort is growing and generating serendipity the fastest. The better this works, the more resources flow in ways that minimize opportunity costs. (Location 1461)

This perception exists primarily because access to the luck of sufficiently weak networks can be slowed down by sufficiently strong geographic world boundaries (what is sometimes called bahramdipity: serendipity thwarted by powerful forces). (Location 1464)

The problems of Wall Street are real, and symptomatic of a true crisis of social and economic mobility in the geographic world. Those of Silicon Valley on the other hand, exist because not everybody is sufficiently plugged into the networked world yet, limiting its power. (Location 1476)

James Robinson call extractive institutions. They are designed not just to solve a specific problem and secure the gains, but to continue extracting wealth indefinitely. Whatever the broader environmental conditions, ideally wealth, harmony and order accumulate inside the victor’s boundaries, while waste, social costs, and strife accumulate outside, to be dealt with by the losers of resource conflicts. (Location 1494)

In the developed world, energy, healthcare and education are examples of sectors where problem-solving has slowed to a crawl due to a maze of regulatory and other boundaries. The result has been escalating costs and declining innovation — what economist William Baumol has labeled the “cost disease.” (Location 1504)

The cost disease is an example of how, in their terminal state, goal-driven problem solving cultures exhaust themselves. Without open-ended innovation, the growing complexity of boundary redrawing makes most problems seem impossible. The planetary computer that is the geographic world effectively seizes up. (Location 1506)

As Giles Deleuze noted around 1992:1 We are in a generalized crisis in relation to all environments of enclosure — prison, hospital, factory, school, family…The administrations in charge never cease announcing supposedly necessary reforms…But everyone knows these environments are finished, whatever the length of their expiration periods. It’s only a matter of administering their last rites and of keeping people employed until the installation of new forces knocking at the door. (Location 1509)

By the early twentieth century, mercantilist economic logic had led to the world being completely carved up in terms of inflexible land, water, air, mineral and — perhaps most relevant today — spectrum rights. Rights that could not be freely traded or renegotiated in light of changing circumstances. (Location 1517)

As the etymology of words like organization and corporation suggests, we tend to view our social containers through anthropomorphic metaphors. We extend metaphoric and legal fictions of identity, personality, birth and death far beyond the point of diminishing marginal utility. (Location 1520)

In fact, in the late crisis-ridden state of the geographic world, the “goal” of a typical problem-solving effort is often to “save” some anthropomorphically conceived part of society, without any critical attention devoted to whether it is still necessary, or whether better alternatives are already serendipitously emerging. (Location 1525)

The dark side of such anthropomorphic romanticization is what we might call geographic dualism: a stable planet-wide separation of local utopian zones secured for a privileged few and increasingly dystopian zones for many, maintained through policed boundaries. (Location 1532)

In a changing environment, organizational stability valued for its own sake becomes a kind of immorality. Seeking such stability means allowing the winners of historic conflicts to enjoy the steady, fixed benefits of stability by imposing increasing adaptation costs on the losers. (Location 1536)

The way complex systems — such as planet-scale computing capabilities — evolve is perhaps best described by a statement known as Gall’s Law: A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start over with a working simple system. Gall’s Law is in fact much too optimistic. (Location 1546)

The idea that a new, simpler system can revitalize a complex system in a state of terminal crisis is the essence of Promethean thinking. Though the geographic world has reached a state of terminal crisis only recently, the seeds of a simpler working system to replace it were actually planted in the eighteenth century, nearly 200 years before software joined the party. The industrial revolution itself was driven by two elements of our world being partially freed from geographic world logic: people and ideas. (Location 1551)

In the eighteenth century, the world gradually rejected the idea that people could be property, to be exclusively claimed by other people or organizations as a problem-solving “resource,” and held captive within specific boundaries. Individual rights and at-will employment models emerged in liberal democracies, in place of institutions like slavery, serfdom and caste-based hereditary professions. (Location 1555)

The second was ideas. Again, in the late eighteenth century, modern intellectual property rights, in the form of patents with expiration dates, became the norm. In ancient China, those who revealed the secrets of silk-making were put to death by the state. In late eighteenth century Britain, the expiration of James Watt’s patents sparked the industrial revolution. (Location 1557)

As Richard Stallman, the pioneer of the open source movement, famously expressed it: The two kinds of freedom are free as in beer and free as in speech. (Location 1563)

First, people and ideas were increasingly free in the sense of no longer being considered “property” to be bought and sold like beer by others. (Location 1564)

But there is a cost to getting organizationally literate. This ability, once acquired, cannot be un-acquired.

A Sociopath with an idea recruits just enough Losers to kick off the cycle. As it grows, it requires a Clueless layer to turn it into a controlled reaction, rather than a runaway explosion. Eventually, as value hits diminishing returns, both the Sociopaths and Losers make their exits, and the Clueless start to dominate. Finally, the hollow brittle shell collapses on itself, and anything of value is recycled by the Sociopaths, according to meta-firm logic. (Location 130)

The Clueless are the ones who lack the competence to circulate freely through the economy (unlike Sociopaths and Losers), and build up a perverse sense of loyalty to the firm, even when events make it abundantly clear that the firm is not loyal to them. To sustain themselves, they must be capable of fashioning elaborate delusions based on idealized notions of the firm – (Location 149)

Powertalk is the in-group language of the Sociopaths. Posturetalk is the language spoken by the Clueless to everybody. They don’t have an in-group language since they don’t realize they constitute a group. Sociopaths and Losers talk back to the Clueless in a language called Babytalk that seems like Posturetalk to the Clueless. Among themselves, Losers speak a language called Gametalk. (Location 299)

I won’t cover it at all, but you can learn all about it in the pop classics on transactional analysis (TA) from 30 years ago: Eric Berne’s Games People Play and What Do You Say after You Say Hello, and Thomas Harris’ I’m OK–You’re OK. (Location 302)

What distinguishes Powertalk is that with every word uttered, the power equation between the two speakers shifts just a little. Sometimes both gain slightly, at the expense of some poor schmuck. Sometimes one yields ground to the other. Powertalk in other words, is a consequential language. (Location 355)

Sociopaths, conditions of conflict of interest and moral hazard are not exceptional. They are normal, everyday situations. To function effectively they must constantly maintain and improve their position in the ecosystem of other Sociopaths, protecting themselves, competing, forming alliances, trading favors and building trust. Above all, they must be wary of Sociopaths with misaligned agendas, and protect themselves in basic ways before attempting things like cooperation. They never lower their masks. In fact they are their masks. There is nothing beneath. (Location 382)

Good Sociopaths operate by what they personally choose as a higher morality, in reaction to what they see as the dangers, insanities and stupidities of mob morality. Evil Sociopaths are merely looking for a quick, safe buck. Losers and the Clueless, of course, avoid individual moral decisions altogether. (Location 389)

A good way to remember this is to think of Powertalk as decisions about what verbal tactics to use when, and with what. The answer to with what is usually a part of your table-stakes. (Location 436)

The second skill is low-level utterance-by-utterance control, which is much harder. You cannot consciously engineer 7-8 meanings and calibrated amounts of power and leverage into every line you utter, through careful word choice. You don’t have the luxury of minutes or hours between responses, though you can do that over email. In most conversations, you have tenths of a second per response. In that time you must steer the tempo of the conversation – its rhythms, emotional subtext and energy level (Location 455)

Well-adjustedness is a measure of the degree to which your worldview is socially acceptable and appropriate in a given environment. Since a messed-up personality can be well-adjusted with respect to a messed-up environment, well-adjustedness has very little to do with sanity and actual mental health. (Location 511)

If your situational reactions are generally appropriate but against your best interests, you are a well-adjusted Loser. If they are both appropriate and in your best interests, you are a Sociopath. (Location 517)

The Three Laws of Arrested Development So far this is trivial stuff, widely understood, and offers nobody any advantage. Here is the non-trivial stuff, compressed into three handy laws: Your development is arrested by your strengths, not your weaknesses.

In their troubled twenties, each seeks the one true love that they know is out there, waiting for them, and their real calling in life. Each time they fail at life or love, their friends console them: “You are a smart, funny, beautiful and incredibly talented person, and the love of your life and your true calling are out there somewhere. I just know that.” The friends are right of course: each marries the most beautiful man or woman in the world, discovers his or her calling, and becomes the proud parent of the most beautiful baby in the world.

Not only can you do this, you will actually feel good doing this. This feeling is called happiness. I don’t have time to go into this, but happiness is entirely a social phenomenon, and there’s plenty of evidence that the best way (and from my reading, the only way) to get happy is to get sociable. Non-social feelings that seem like happiness turn out, upon further examination, to be distinct emotions like contentment, equanimity or hedonistic pleasure. (Location 1020)

Psychologically, you cringe when you realize you are committing a social faux pas and can expect a negative social-proof judgment. Again, this cringing helps – you interrupt the offending behavior and try to recover. Empathic social cringing is even more effective among Losers, since you can watch my developing “embarrassed for you” reaction to moderate your own behavior in time. (Location 1033)

So cringing is physical and psychological anticipatory damage control, and is powered by both individual anticipation and empathic sharing of feeling. Normally, cringing is a self-moderating impulse, since it dampens the behavior that causes it, either in yourself, or in others. (Location 1037)

a side-effect, they also manufacture transient meanings to fuel the theaters of religiosity (including various secular religions) that lend meaning to lives of Losers and the Clueless. (Location 1401)

Whether they dismiss prevailing accounts as rationalizations and begin a search for deeper meanings, or defy expectations and reach for power beyond their station, Sociopaths begin their unscripted journeys to rid themselves of that fundamental dissatisfaction; the sense that reality is more complex than whatever is being presented to them. That important things are being hidden from view, and not for their own good. (Location 1415)

The Sociopath’s journey, mythologized to serve the religious needs of the Clueless, is what gives us the Hero’s Journey. Mythologized in a different way to serve Loser religiosity, the Sociopath becomes the priestly agent of larger intangible forces, offering absolution for sins and unpredictable signs of grace. (Location 1423)

To the Sociopath, the very same journey, lived from the inside, is a nihilistic journey into emptiness, a gradual abandonment of the possibility of ultimate meanings. (Location 1425)

Amorality is merely the first step. As the journey proceeds, Sociopaths progressively rip away layer after layer of social reality. The Sociopath’s journey can be understood as progressive unmasking of a sequence of increasingly ancient and fearsome gods, each reigning over a harsher social order, governing fewer humans. If morality falls by the wayside when the first layer is ripped away, other reassuring certainties, such as the idea of a benevolent universe, and predictable relationships between efforts and rewards, fall away in deeper layers.

From the persona they present to the Clueless, they subtract human fallibility and imperfection, presenting an illusory ideal of heroic perfection for the Clueless to identify with, and hopelessly strive toward.

the Sociopath’s role is marked by a withdrawal of information from the scene: information about their own personalities and inner lives, and information about specific situations and material realities. (Location 1598)

Sociopathy is not about ripping off a specific mask from the face of social reality. It is about recognizing that there are no social realities. There are only masks. Social realities exist as a hierarchy of increasingly sophisticated and specialized fictions for those predisposed to believe that there is something special about the human condition, which sets our realities apart from the rest of the universe. (Location 1620)

There is, to the Sociopath, only one reality governing everything from quarks to galaxies. Humans have no special place within it. Any idea predicated on the special status of the human – such as justice, fairness, equality, talent – is raw material for a theater of mediated realities that can be created via subtraction of conflicting evidence, polishing and masking. (Location 1623)

Mask is an appropriate term for any social reality created through subtraction, because an appearance of human-like agency for non-human realities is what the inhabitants require. By humanizing the non-human universe, we make the human special. (Location 1626)

When a layer of social reality is penetrated and turned into a means for manipulating the realities of others, it is automatically devalued. (Location 1635)

To devalue something is to judge any meaning it carries as inconsequential. In terms of our metaphor of masks of gods, the moment you rip off a mask and wear it yourself, whatever that mask represents becomes worth much less. So the Sociopath’s journey is fundamentally a nihilistic one. (Location 1638)

In that moment, the Sociopath viscerally experiences the vast inner emptiness that results from the sudden dissolution of all social realities. There’s just a pile of masks with no face beneath. Just quarks and stuff (it is interesting that we have chosen to label the Higgs boson the “god” particle; our mask-seeking is truly desperate). (Location 1646)

This is reality shock: the visceral experience of the fact that there is only one reality, with no special place for humans. (Location 1649)

The truth of social realities as canvases for fiction for those who choose to create them. The truth of values as crayons in the pockets of unsupervised Sociopaths. The truth of the non-centrality of humans in the larger scheme of things. (Location 1691)

creative-destruction becomes merely the act of living free, not a divinely ordained imperative or a primal urge. Creative destruction is not a script, but the absence of scripts. (Location 1694)

Of those who weather reality shock, most simply accept their life and their permanent estrangement from non-Sociopaths. They have ascended to freedoms they cannot explain to those who do not possess them. They are somewhere between contemptuous and mildly indulgent towards those who inhabit the realities they create. Indifference is the default middle-ground attitude. (Location 1706)

The dissolution of social realities leaves behind only the cryptic material universe that must be painstakingly decoded through that supremely nihilistic behavior, scientific inquiry. (Location 1719)

Human life is like walking into a movie halfway through, and having to walk out again two minutes later. You’ll have no idea what’s going on when you walk in. And chances are, just as you begin to get a clue, you’ll be kicked out. So unless you are lucky enough to walk in during a scene that is satisfying without any longer narrative context (think sex or violence), your ability to derive satisfaction from your two-minute glimpse will depend partly on your ability to construct meaning out of it. One way to do this is to pretend to be immortal. (Location 38)

So long as you walk away feeling like you’ve just enjoyed an entire movie, it doesn’t matter. To do this at the level of an entire life is to spend much of your time having one-way conversations with the dead and the unborn, through books read and written. You inhabit a world of ghosts while walking among the living. (Location 47)

Humans are somewhat unique among living things in their capacity for mourning the loss of things they never had in the first place. (Location 58)

Because we can read a historical or science-fiction tale and vicariously experience a low-fidelity version of the distant past or future, we can experience a sense of loss about not being able to experience the real thing more fully and directly. So we are designed for pretend immortality. (Location 63)

Meaning-seekers are afraid of misreading the universe; extracting false meanings out of it. They seek immortality primarily to get to more satisfying and meaningful readings of their condition. Seeking direct experience is a secondary, pragmatic objective in specific situations, it is not the raison d’être. Experience-seekers are afraid of missing out on the rich direct experiences the universe offers. They seek immortality primarily to directly experience more of the universe. Seeking meaning is a secondary, pragmatic objective in specific situations, it is not the raison d’être. (Location 72)

Ghosts seek appreciative knowledge of both past and future. Vampires seek manipulative knowledge from both past and future, but as a means to changing the future. (Location 85)

The universe could be one huge string of random numbers that cannot be compressed down to anything smaller than the universe itself, or it could be so fractally compact that you could describe it using a little generative computer program that fits within a few kilobytes. If you’ve thought and read about these things, you’ll recognize them as the Douglas Adams and Stephen Wolfram/digital physics assumptions about the nature of reality. (Location 144)

But how much you seek to see, versus how much you seek to do, represents a real trade-off. You choose based on your preferred mix of meaning extraction and direct experience. (Location 171)

Every few months, one of my much more successful friends will get frustrated by my apparent lack of aggressive hustle in service of my own work, and declare that I could be 10x better known and make 10x as much money if only I did x. The unstated assumption is that I am perversely being a precious snowflake by not doing x. (Location 186)

When you see someone as a precious snowflake, you are essentially seeing someone whose inner child is stronger, relatively speaking, than your own. Someone who needs you to “be the adult” in the relationship, at least for a while. (Location 218)

The snowflake on the other hand will see you as something of a clod (which seems like an apt term for an anti-snowflake: a lump of damp soul-soil, such as might be created by the melting of a snowflake): a despised but necessary part of their life. A clod is someone with a base soul, so to speak. Either lacking, or having lost, the delicacy of sensibilities and unique aliveness to the experience of life that define a precious snowflake. A clod is someone who blunders through life, apparently soul-dead, seemingly unaware of the cringing they induce in others, on the way to success. Often, the perceptions are correct. (Location 225)

subjectivity involved in judging success, clod and snowflake actually agree on the implicit definition of success in play, at least within the scope of a single conversation. The definition that clod and snowflake agree on is simple: success is that real world process which, in the eyes of both, has somewhat destroyed/is actively destroying the clod in the relationship. Of course, neither will admit it. (Location 238)

That is the reason the conversation proceeds at all. If snowflakes were truly offended by the crass obliviousness of the clod to their sensibilities and aesthetics, they would walk away. If clods were truly resentful of the lack of acknowledgement of their greater worldliness, they too would walk away. Snowflakes stay in the conversation because they sense their inner child is too strong and needs to be weakened and put to work. Clods stay in the conversation because their inner child is too weak and needs validation and a reprieve from work. That is the unspoken narrative of the relationship. (Location 241)

For example, I often feel like a snowflake when richer people are telling me how to make more money, but like a clod when I am talking to the exact same people about how to manage perceptions with words or manipulate others with cheap tricks. (Location 256)

Still, there is such a thing as a culturally institutionalized clod-snowflake relationship. Artists, musicians and poets are generally snowflakes; technologists, business people and politicians are clods. Elsewhere in our fractal universe, technologists are the snowflakes and financiers are clods. In still other parts of our world, financiers are the snowflakes, and evil politicians are the clods. In cop shows, honor-driven detectives are snowflakes, while cynical lawyers are the clods. In thrillers, local cops are snowflakes, and the FBI are clods. (Location 258)

In one of my favorite movies, Barton Fink, John (Location 269)

The clod-snowflake relationship is about the clod willingly ceding some of his or her greater freedom (the fruits of “success”) to the snowflake, who both agree is able to put it to a “higher” use. The (Location 280)

general, you are a clod in that area of life where you are something of a professional. The area of life where you remain in control of your emotions and the situation no matter what the world throws at you. Usually, this ability is worth money or some other reward. You are a snowflake in the area of life that can evoke the most uncontrolled emotions in you, or cause you to freeze up. (Location 286)

there is only funerary culture. That second link is to an app for managing your own death called Cake. (Location 300)

Once society stops doing culture to you, and you’re on your own, immortality begins. The morning after your fortieth birthday, you experience the first day of the rest of time. (Location 318)

Time, of course, is the merciless slaughterer of all these infinitely qualified anchors of the meaning of life. Wait long enough, and every truth will crumble. Wait long enough, and every value will dissolve into moral ambiguity. Wait long enough, and every habit will decay, first into ritual, then into farce. (Location 326)

I’ll call any emotionally coherent collection of truths, values and habits meaning. (Location 332)

What really drives home the visceral sense of the transience of all meaning is the realization, around forty, that not only is nobody going to supply you with comforting permanences anymore, but that you have to begin to repay a debt you did not realize you had incurred. You have to create meaning games for others to play. There are not many other jobs for the 40-to-Ω crowd. (Location 336)

The transience of the seemingly permanent is well-recognized, even though Buddhists around the world work hard to mystify it. A word or two about the permanence of the seemingly transient. (Location 344)

The transient experiences keep coming back, but the meanings they destroy don’t. Indeed, the permanence of transience is merely the negative space formed by the creative destruction of meaning. Change, as the saying goes, is the only constant. (Location 348)

Culture is the necessary art of perpetuating the disturbing rumor that reality is meaningful. (Location 350)

Redistributing meaning requires creating strongly escaped realities by sealing off inconveniently meaningless bits of reality. Things like religion fall into this category. By shifting Significance from Some Things to Some Other Things, redistribution can manufacture a new signal from old noise, and motivate the restlessness and motion the world requires of the α to 40 set. (Location 360)

To seek meaning is to believe in truth before virtue, virtue before beauty, beauty before creation, creation before victory. This is the honor code of meaning-seeking. If you follow this code perfectly, you will make exactly no money. (Location 376)

This means, incidentally, that you should avoid the temptation to figure life out completely. Because the great risk is you’ll simplify your life until it can be completely figured out. In fact, if you sense that happening, you must immediately do something pointlessly confusing and complicate your life so it gets back to the edge of incoherence. (Location 521)

Of course, you can’t entirely avoid drawing lessons from whatever you’ve been up to, but so long as you don’t let it get out of hand, you’re relatively safe. If you can’t figure it all out and fit the pieces together, chances are high that nobody else can either. Which means nobody can be entirely certain whether you’re part of humanity or not. (Location 526)

We generally fail to understand the extent to which both our sense of agency and identity are a function of memory. (Location 548)

To paraphrase computing pioneer Frederick Brooks, reveal your thinking and hide your memories and I will understand nothing about you, hide your thinking and reveal your memories and I will understand everything about you. Call this view the memory determinism view of identity and agency. In pure form, memory determinism can be defined as the existential position: If you’d been through what I have, you’d think as I think and do as I do. (Location 564)

the way long-term memories are formed is that raw sensory memories are gradually integrated into a coherent narrative and then settle again into a sort of edited sensory memory with an associated narrative. (Location 573)

At higher levels of the Maslow hierarchy, imagination is a survival skill. At the apex, where self-actualization is the primary concern, lack of imagination means death. Metaphoric death followed by literal death of the sort that tortured artists achieve through suicide. (Location 734)

Unlike imagination-optional life problems, self-actualization is a problem which requires imagination because it is about facing up to the part of you that is unique, whether or not you actually want to be different. The part that is one-in-seven-billion-unique. That part that can turn into a psychological cancer and kill you if you repress it too strongly. (Location 777)

the principle of maximal variety goes deeper: within an individual self-actualizing life, the future is not like the past and the person is consistently surprising to himself/herself as well as others). (Location 781)

We live in a milieu where the idea of the “real you” is either exoticized as an elusive thing that the privileged search for via expensive retreats to Bali, or a farcical escapist fantasy constructed by the moronically self-indulgent. Eat, Pray, Love unapologetically sacralizes the former. Dave Barry accurately skewers the latter in his hilarious review of 50 Shades of Grey. (Location 844)

For want of a better term, I’ll call it the daemon. The daemon is the opposite of the mask. It is simply the accumulating pile of inner realities, which acquires form and definition to the extent that it is consciously recognized by the being it possesses. (Location 850)

When the mask wins, you are treated like a person, but don’t feel like one (what I called gollumization is a special extreme case). When the daemon wins, you feel like a person but are treated as less than one by others. Either zero-sum outcome is the beginning of the end. The only way out is to integrate the mask and the daemon in a non-zero-sum way. This is self-actualization and it takes imagination. (Location 855)

A shadow is a daemon that can be seen when embodied in external form, but not necessarily recognized as a part of yourself. The only sign you get is an obsessive attachment to a part of your environment (often an evil twin or a nerdy interest) that you cannot explain. (Location 863)

This makes shadow creativity no more than a controlled, self-limiting and aestheticized version of the homeless man’s rant on the street corner. It serves to create a unique identity for the speaker and signal that the mask is not dominant, but it does not actually have much effect beyond that. The reason such creativity only attracts similar creators is that the shadows of similar people are similar, and tend to project onto shared external realities. The result is shared meaning and patterns of mutual esteem that exclude those who are dissimilar. (Location 881)

imagination is the ability to create unpredictable new meaning while generating more freedom than you consume. (Location 892)

The experience of being imaginative is simply the experience of being alive to possibilities, in an open-ended way. The experience of seeing many possible meanings and futures in any given fragment of external reality (and not just the ones your shadow has chosen to inhabit). (Location 893)

You feed imagination by being curious about things beyond your own shadow. (Location 897)

Self-actualization is the imaginative embodiment of internal realities (what the daemon feels) in the form of a dent in the universe: a surprising and free external reality that actualizes a new possibility for all. (Location 904)

An example is a new technological artifact that might be put to wildly different uses by a kid in Mongolia and an executive in New York, with very different shadows. (Location 907)

When outflow and inflow are in a dynamic balance, harmonizing mask and daemon continuously, in an environment with just enough surplus chaos to occupy surplus freedom and drive the process, you get sustained generativity: the process of manufacturing more freedom than you consume through the act of living. The mask comes alive and the daemon shines through. The longer you are able to do that, the bigger the dent you leave behind in the universe. (Location 932)

Divergentism is the idea that as individuals grow out into the universe, they diverge from each other in thought-space. (Location 940)

I’ve had a lot of interactions with people to whom meaning seems to matter a great deal. People for whom the search for meaning is always a very urgent existential matter, rather than an occasional sudoku-like diversion. Most of these people are hedgehogs and convergentists, though not all. I’ve learned two things from these conversations. First, they don’t seem to mean the same thing I do when I think about meaning. To convergentists, the absence of meaning (always easier to notice than meaning itself), seems to correspond to the material notion of silence rather than some metaphysical notion of nihilism. For less evolved convergentists, who are as easily traumatized by dissent as by indifference, even a condition of more noes than yeses to can you hear me now? is sufficient to create a feeling of absent meaning. (Location 986)

Second, to convergentists, meaning and value are the same thing. For a thing to have meaning is for that thing to have value and vice versa. It must have a place in a narrativized universe in which there is no room for non sequiturs, or true surprisal. This value can only be socially situated. Things that might potentially be valued without being socially situated are, almost by definition, excluded from contributing to meaning. (Location 992)

So I speculate that to convergentists, meaning is fundamentally a social thing: not only is all shared ideology about meaning, all meaning is about shared ideology. (Location 996)

“I need to do something meaningful with my life, it feels empty. I need purpose” is simply another way of saying, can you hear me now? (Location 999)

Confirmation bias is not a minor bug in our attempts to learn and grow, it is a feature in our attempts to create and stabilize meaning in the face of the ever-present entropic allure of divergence. (Location 1003)

The key is to freak out early and freak out often (FEFO) in an agile way, and work towards a lifestyle that (ideally) feels like one continuously integrated and deployed mid-life crisis. There is actually good intellectual justification for approaching life this way. It’s called the Lindy effect, which says you’ll live as long again as you already have, until you don’t. Which means you’re always at mid-life. Until you’re not. (Location 1015)

which is really about using Design to render visible the invisible nature of your place in the universe. A mid-life crisis is just one example of such a project.

you’re almost certainly not on what engineers call the critical path of the many-streamed flow of history. If you are on the critical path, your delays delay the universe.

Critical paths — which, as a reminder, are the paths you are likely not on — are the stuff of what historians like to call Big Histories. Big Men like Elon Musk are the ex-officio heroes of Big Histories. (Location 1129)

Big Men are people through whom the course of the history of universe flows like a mighty torrent of Significance and Meaning (those are German nouns, so they must always be capitalized). Delays in whose lives delay the whole universe and make the whole show a little less meaningful for all. (Location 1132)

A mid-life crisis is not a way to recenter yourself in the universe through an act of epistemology. It is a way to recenter the universe around yourself through an act of architecture. An act of architecture capable of making the universe all about you. (Location 1243)

As Barbara Ehrenreich argues in Bright-Sided it was almost entirely a social phenomenon: The largest demographic to suffer from neurasthenia or invalidism was middle-class women. Male prejudice barred them from higher education and the professions; industrialization was stripping away the productive tasks that had occupied women in the home, from sewing to soap-making. For many women, invalidism became a kind of alternative career. Days spent reclining in chaise lounges, attended by doctors and family members and devoted to trying new medicines and medical regimens, substituted for masculine “striving” in the world.

Invalidism was a peculiarly American condition that later spread worldwide. In fact, it was called “Americanitis” for a while. (Location 1270)

Be Slightly Evil

So truth is also about increasing moral minimalism. As you learn more, you should have less need for moral opinions. Or as the French-Swiss novelist Madame de Stael once said, “When you understand everything, you can forgive everything.” We may never reach that asymptotic state within our human lifespans, but every little bit of pointless moral “responsibility” you can shrug off helps. But perhaps the biggest deep idea behind Be Slightly Evil is thermodynamics. I am endlessly fascinated by the idea of entropy. It suggests that not only is the universe indifferent to our presence, it is at least mildly hostile to it. We are low-entropy creatures trying hopelessly to swim upstream in a universe that’s gradually winding down towards a maximum-entropy heat death. So the universe itself is, in a sense, Slightly Evil. So by some sort of fractal logic, as little subsets of the universe, our true nature is probably slightly evil as well. Of course, this is a wild metaphysical leap in the dark, but something about this conjecture appeals to me at a deep level. (Location 104)

In the worst cases, the stress of being alone with the filtered-out realities that you cannot share, can break you. You can regress into child-like behaviors because you decide to take your turn at being the “child.” You are tired of being the adult, and you’re going to abdicate for a bit whether others like it or not.

bitter, angry middle-management types. (Location 443)

They are losers caught in clueless positions, with eroded individual contributor skills. They can’t move up, they can’t move down. They’re too much company men/women to easily leave and find other jobs. They only leave if fired or laid off. So they silently endure as more work is piled on. Why is this dangerous? This is the beginning of the end for organizations. In this state, smart people start exiting from both top and bottom as and when they are able to engineer exits. (Location 453)

Thomas Hobbes made a fundamentally pessimistic assumption: that humans in this state of nature are fundamentally competitive, violent and corruptible (tending to become more evil or wicked if left to themselves). For Hobbes, evil is natural, good is an aberration. Hobbes’ is a tragic view of the human condition. (Location 681)

Jean-Jacques Rousseau on the other hand made a fundamentally optimistic assumption: that humans in the natural state are fundamentally harmony-loving, cooperative and perfectible (tending to become more good and noble, left to themselves). For Rousseau, good is natural and evil is an aberration. Rousseau’s is an idealist view of the human condition. (Location 684)

the key change required is to think of extended kinship groups and tribes as the fundamental units among which egalitarian conditions reign.

Whatever you want, getting it involves correctly adapting to their predictable status behaviors. You can threaten their projected status, in which case they’ll move to defend it. You can validate it, in which case they’ll may move to express gratitude or ignore you. You can combine the two moves by first attacking and then validating. This is the familiar “give people a way to save face” sequence. Be (Location 778)

Once your status firmware starts to shrivel, you can’t easily re-invigorate it. Being a status-player is also not an easy thing to hide in the long term, so you will be known for what you are, by people you interact with a lot. The best way to manage this perception is to openly acknowledge it and make sure your underlying values are understood and accepted by others. If you don’t make that clear, you’ll end up being viewed as an opportunistic, two-faced politician, and that perception is highly dangerous. Project your values clearly, and you’ll come across as “worldly wise,” a much safer perception. (Location 798)

To wield influence, it pays to appear predictable in very simple ways around others. Fly your true colors high. (Location 818)

What kind of behaviors should you deliberately publish? The ones others are afraid of triggering. In other words, the only buttons worth publishing are the ones others are afraid to push. (Location 824)

The recommended and stupid way is to directly engage it in a cooperative spirit. This never works unless there is genuinely some sort of misunderstanding that can be easily clarified. This is the well-known “death by consensus seeking” phenomenon where you try far too hard to make everybody happy and end up slowing down your effort to a glacial pace. You also burden it with so much crud put in to please others, it will likely die under the weight of unreasonable expectations if it ever gets through. Consensus-building has its place in the slightly evil playbook, but it is rarely a useful obstacle-avoidance technique. (Location 864)

The smart way is to acknowledge the reality of true conflict and judiciously decide, for each obstacle, whether to go through it or around it. Going through means confronting somebody openly and trying to either win them over to your side without conceding much in return, or getting a more powerful decision-maker to rule in your favor. Going around means picking from among your favorite slightly evil moves in the playbook, such as misdirection, distraction, pre-emptive neutralization before they know what you are up to, sidelining, flattery, stealth, divide-and-conquer, momentum judo (accelerating their efforts to failure rather (Location 869)

This means you must generally pick on someone nominally bigger than you (older, bigger paycheck, nicer title, more successful track record) who isn’t particularly well-liked or connected. But not so much bigger that open conflict would be viewed as unhealthy for the organization, even if the specific target is viewed as deserving of a beat-down. In other words, you have to set up and win an underdog fight, where you’re not too much of an underdog. You must also anticipate and plan for neutralizing collateral damage, and make sure the right audience is watching. (Location 881)

Playing exactly by the rules is a powerful form of industrial collective action known as “work to rule,”†† in which workers stick religiously to their job descriptions, defined policies and procedures. You don’t stop work. You don’t deliberately slow down. You don’t try extra-hard to be incompetent or make errors. You don’t even indulge in creative passive-aggressive obstruction. (Location 898)

It also explains why petty bureaucrats (the “clueless” in the GP sense) are basically parasites, because they lack the creativity to go beyond roles and rules in productive ways. They are effectively (and usually without any malicious intent) in “work to rule” mode all the time, and only earn their keep during events when others use them as pawns. Michael on The Office is worse than this, since he does go beyond roles and rules, but in ways that make things worse (for example, trying ham-handed conflict resolution that increases conflict, or attempting to boost morale in ways that actually lower it). (Location 911)

The dynamics behind “work to rule” explain why the following are among the most dangerous threats (intended or unintended) a worker can make: “Not in my job description.” “I am just following the rules.” “Our policy is...” “We are not allowed to work on weekends.” “I am not authorized to do that.” “I don’t know what the policy is on that, I’ll have to ask my manager.” (Location 915)

Second, in case you hadn’t noticed, very few well-adjusted people (“well-adjusted” is not a compliment in my book) lie outright about anything consequential. The risk of being caught out in a lie is too high. They usually mumble, talk in circles, avoid certain subjects, act evasive, deflect or equivocate. All these behaviors are easy enough to detect and challenge if you feel inclined to do so. Here, the skill to be learned isn’t how to detect, but how to challenge such behaviors without provoking the person to anger. We’ll deal with that another day. The (Location 979)

point is, the everyday social world is not a harsh and dangerous one built on widespread deceit. It is mostly a slightly timid, risk-averse and benign world, full of people who are uncomfortable lying about anything serious.

For them, candor is a way to relieve the stress of keeping emotionally loaded ideas bottled-up inside. They are being candid not because the situation demands it, but because they can’t bear the stress of not being candid. Truth-telling requires you to first calmly separate your feelings from the facts and tell yourself the truth before you tell others. Candid people often fail to separate things this way and blurt out unprocessed thoughts. (Location 992)

The second behavior is cursing. When somebody gets mad and offers an opinion interspersed with curses. (“Look, let’s just admit the fucking truth here okay? That asshole was out to screw us all along! We got played.”) Again there is a failure to separate facts from the emotions associated with the facts, and an easy slide into aggressive posturing, under threat. The narrative that is offered is designed to bolster sagging self-confidence, seek validation and unconsciously simplify unpleasant realities in self-serving ways (being “blunt” blunts the truth). Opinions offered with a seasoning of curses will usually lack all sorts of key details. (Location 997)

So what does genuine truth-telling feel like? It feels like clarity. When someone has processed their thoughts, separated fact from feeling, separated what is already known from what is new or as yet unknown, and is offering up something they’ve deduced as being both true and unknown to you (and hence worth sharing), you’ll experience at least a momentary sense of expanded clarity. Candor and cursing on the other hand, will provoke emotional responses from you, rather than moments of mental clarity. (Location 1005)

This is a fantastically valuable skill to learn. And a very difficult one. It goes well beyond thick skin. It is hardened-cop-style “anything you say can and will be used against you” listening. (Location 1043)

Get beyond thick skin: the only way to get to total impassivity in the face of strident criticism and insults is practice. And I am afraid this means developing a certain capacity for contempt. (Location 1045)

Beyond-thick-skinned, contemptuous listening means you don’t take what is said about your personality as serious feedback worth responding to. But this does not mean you don’t listen. You listen in a sort of objective, clinical way, like a researcher observing an angry animal in a cage. Your radar is primed for information that is useful to you, not information that the other party thinks you ought to know (and is maliciously delighted to be able to give you). (Location 1047)

And remember, listening does not mean agreeing or debating. You can choose to listen, draw your own conclusions, and walk away, or steer the conversation so it proceeds on terms that are useful to you (as Spacey did). You don’t have to convince the other person of your conclusions. Or even share them. Notice how Williamson doesn’t reveal his “you robbed the office” conclusion until after he’s done testing it as a hypothesis by following the clue and watching Levene fumble. Levene has no clue why Williamson is asking about the “made up” line, and Williamson doesn’t bother to explain. He just assumes, like any good alpha, that he doesn’t have to explain himself to Levene, and that he’ll get a revealing response without having to explain the question. (Location 1050)

When criticized, too many people fall into one of two basic errors. The first is to take the criticism as true on the face of it, without analysis, and earnestly attempt to change. That’s just dumb. The second is to assume the criticism says more about the criticizer’s personality than about yours. This is the “explain it away” defense mechanism. No, we aren’t talking about either of those reactions here. The first is born of low self-esteem; the second is born out of a denial. What we are talking about here can only be practiced by people with a high degree of self-awareness and self-acceptance. This means most conversations can be processed in transactional terms (looking for information of value in the immediate situation, the robbery being navigated in this case) rather than getting sidetracked protecting your fragile ego from poisoned barbs being shot at you by inconsequential people. (Location 1061)

But opening yourself up to such accusations at all is the amateur way to play it. The way to really protect yourself is to adopt George Costanza’s law: it’s not a lie if you believe in it. (Location 1112)

To win the Yossarian belt, you have to genuinely graduate to ironic absurdity, and traffic in delusions without getting attached to them. Without a sense of absurdity, you’ll just fall off the slightly evil path and turn into yet another greedy hack, peddling subprime mortgages. (Location 1129)

An interpersonal interaction is open if both parties are seeking to trade or discover information. It is closed if even one party is seeking status validation, conflict or harmony instead. This means, unfortunately, that most interpersonal interactions end up being about such social intentions, since either party can unilaterally close an open interaction. (Location 1133)

So you get the following four basic types of attitude informing an interaction: Condescension: I am better than you and for you Contempt: I am better than you and against you Supplication: I am worse than you and for you Insolence: I am worse than you and against you It is very useful to learn to recognize these four attitudes. (Location 1140)

Wherever possible, you should attempt to move the conversation to an open one that is about generating or exchanging information, or disengage if that turns out to be impossible. (Location 1161)

The key to conflict without ego is the observation that you cannot get mad at facts. The sun rises everyday. Things fall to the ground. You need to pay employees. (Location 1216)

But why conflict at all? If you can truly approach interpersonal interactions in this ego-less way, with intrinsic motivations handled, and all objective facts and extrinsic motivations on the discussion table, shouldn’t you be able to avoid conflict altogether? I came up with this formulation: Violence is a necessary consequence of unavoidable ignorance on the part of systems that lack infinite wisdom. You cannot avoid it, or enlighten yourself out of it.

The ideas of your friends are not always the friends of your ideas. (Location 1247)

And when these paths of idea pursuit diverge, you must either capitulate and follow, or fight. If you like to wax spiritual about such stuff, you can tell yourself that you are just one tiny bundle of atoms that is part of a universe that is slowly figuring itself out and getting enlightened. You might have to fight today so that the whole world is slightly more enlightened tomorrow. (Location 1255)

Eleanor Roosevelt quote captures it beautifully: “Great minds discuss ideas, average minds discuss events, small minds discuss people.” (Location 1259)

When a friendship can stand the test of sometimes-diverging, sometimes-converging pursuit of individual ideas, it acquires great depth. Relationships based on false harmony and denial of ideas, or worse, one party cravenly abandoning their own ideas in the interests of preserving the relationship, are fundamentally weak, and not worth very much.

What does the information pre-work actually consist of? Definitions and technical analysis. You define all options, and use all the data to model the risks and rewards properly.

About the only firm truth in negotiation is that people who are going to terminate all relationships and walk away very soon behave very differently from people who aren’t sure how much they’ll be dealing with each other in the future. (Location 1318)

The answer is that sunk costs only have a seductive appeal to those who are attached to their subjective past. They do not like the thought that the person they were, two days ago, was possibly engaged in futile activity. They want to behave in ways that redeem their past days. (Location 1380)

Slightly-evil people, either by nature or through cultivation, are simply incapable of thinking this way. They place the most value on external, tangible outcomes. (Location 1382)

Revenge emerges when you add up two traits: an innate tendency towards vindictiveness and a capacity for long-range planning. Vindictiveness is simpler and much more fundamental. In tribal societies it leads to vendetta dynamics. In civilized societies, it leads to revenge dynamics. (Location 1404)

Vindictiveness is a hard-wired operating assumption that if somebody is initiating a conflict with you, they are probably in the wrong. (Location 1414)

Getting even is the key phrase here. Vindictiveness is a status-leveling move. If somebody hurts you, it doesn’t matter what the reasons and backstory are. If you don’t hurt them back, you’ve lost status points. (Location 1427)

This also explains why (again, in tribal societies) it is rational to push back harder than you were pushed. You prefer a decisive outcome to the shoving/pushing/shouting contest for three reasons, especially if there are witnesses. First, you should visibly exact a penalty for the opponent starting an unjustified conflict. Second, the opponent knows personally not to mess with you again, out of real fear of hurt. And third, if he does spread his own version of the story, even if he convinces his friends that he was morally right, you actually get PR for your not-to-be-messed-with reputation, because you won the actual fight.

Hence the wisdom in Hanlon’s Razor: never attribute to malice what can be adequately explained by stupidity. (Location 1513)

A nominal organizational peer attempting to assert authority over you by “delegating” work to you over email requires immediate pushback to establish the right status relationship. Possibly with a cc to the joint manager. And yes, this does create a problem for the manager to deal with. That’s his/her job: to civilize the essentially tribal interaction for the greater good. (Location 1527)

First things first. Petard is a French term for a small bomb used to blow up fortifications. Apparently, during medieval sieges, they were hoisted into strategic positions before being blown up, and the engineer lighting the fuse would sometimes get entangled in the ropes and get hoisted up along with the bomb, and blown up. Hence the phrase. In modern usage, the phrase is used to describe the tactic of using somebody’s own arguments against them. Like using somebody’s own momentum against them in martial arts, this is a very basic principle. Here’s a typical example you might (Location 1544)

the principle of conservation of deception: at any given level of moral and intellectual development, there is an associated minimum level of deception in your life. If you aren’t deceiving others, you are likely deceiving yourself. Or you’re in denial. (Location 1617)

The question of deception arises when you are in a situation where you have a skill or information advantage over another decision-maker. How you use that advantage depends on four things: alignment of intentions, your relationship to the other party, the relative value of a win to the two parties, and the degree of moral certainty you have about your intentions. (Location 1625)

Next, you get equivocation, or sharing of information in ambiguous ways. (Location 1643)

At the final level of sophistication, you get not-correcting-others. You don’t lie, misdirect, withhold or equivocate. But when others are drawing false conclusions that you could correct if you chose to (or missing inferences that are obvious to you due to your greater skill), you selectively choose not to help them out. If they make no mistakes and miss nothing, you’ve given your entire advantage away, though. (Location 1645)

When you get good at not-correcting-others in helpful ways, you become a good teacher. (Location 1654)

Any sort of deception, to be justifiable within your personal morality, needs to be driven by a certain amount of moral certainty regarding your own intentions. (Location 1655)

“You must be willing to look foolish.” Why is this bad advice? It is bad advice because it turns the manageable problem of damage control into some kind of holy cross that you must necessarily, and passively, bear. People who hand out this piece of advice typically do so while striking a pious, quasi-religious pose. They make it sound as though looking foolish were necessary atonement for your sins of risk-taking. (Location 1673)

“You must accept the consequences” is the start of a dangerous line of advice that also leads to “you should take one for the team,” hara kiri, captains “going down with the ship,” and other (usually unnecessary) acts of martyrdom. There are times and places when honor and such noble acts of self-sacrifice might be appropriate (usually actual battlefields are involved), but they are truly rare. Most of the time, nobody needs to die. (Location 1679)

As a principal in a risky endeavor, unless you are prone to denial, you’ll realize that failure is unavoidable long before others do. This means you have the most time and control over consequences, which includes a degree of control over how, where and when others find out what’s happening, and how they react. (Location 1690)

Of all potential consequences, “looking foolish” is the most damaging. You can rebuild assets, re-establish trust and credibility and find life-lines and future opportunities in even the worst chaos. But once people start thinking of you as “foolish,” you’ve put yourself in a pigeonhole that is very hard to climb out of. (Location 1695)

A basic truth about risk management is that old saw, “success has many parents, while failure is an orphan.” If there’s a win, you fight for as much of a share as you can (for yourself, or for a broader group whose interests you represent). If there’s a failure, you rush to dissipate consequences as widely and as far away from yourself as possible. (Location 1702)

But once you’ve learned how to be annoying for no reason, and avoided the temptations of the danger zone, you can graduate to being selectively annoying in calibrated ways when you have a good reason. Why would you ever want to do that? Quite simply, because people who are in an annoyed state behave more predictably than those who are in a non-annoyed state, where they are actually thinking. If you ever need to stop somebody from thinking too much about something, and more benign methods like flattery, distraction or avoidance fail, you escalate by being annoying. (Location 1721)

It is far easier, and far more valuable, to annoy people using their strengths, than by using their weaknesses. In fact, you cannot really annoy people by attacking their weaknesses. You can only insult them and buy anger and resentment that might come back to bite you in the form of vindictiveness. When you annoy people using their strengths on the other hand, they tend to get frustrated with themselves, rather than angry at you. (Location 1725)

all arrested development is caused by strengths, not weaknesses. If you get too good at something, you get addicted to those rewards, and your behavior around that strength gets predictable, even if highly effective. (Location 1731)

In information wars, filters are power and useless data are weapons. (Location 1744)

When two parties have divergent agendas, the party that controls data flows is usually the one that wins. To control how a decision is framed and made, you have to control the data flows that feed into that decision. This requires two levels of work. First, you have to frame the decision. This step determines which data are deemed important and relevant. Second, you have to hide some data and exaggerate the importance of other data. (Location 1746)

if the bull doesn’t restrain himself/herself. The basic trick is simple: you repeat all or part of their opening line, but with zero emotional content. Deadpan. (Location 1853)

Here’s are a few examples: Bull: HAVE YOU HEARD? THIS IS BULLCRAP! You: This is bullcrap? Bull: I AM NOT PUTTING UP WITH THIS! THEY’VE MOVED MY DESK TO THE BASEMENT! You: They’ve moved your desk to the basement? Bull (crying or close to it): Whha–wwhat am I going to do now? I am screwed. You: You’re screwed? This works because of the basic dynamics of emotions. When faced with an emotionally charged stimulus, your own emotional reaction will race ahead and censor the options generated by your cognitive reaction. (Location 1856)

What happens next? Usually, the bull will see your response as a request for elaboration. Elaboration takes coherent thinking, so he/she will be forced to slow down before saying anything more. (Location 1866)

experience maximization: you become afraid, not of bad things happening, but missing out on good things. But as the idea of the bucket list demonstrates, fear of “missing out” is simply another manifestation of insurance-driven thinking. If you had all the time in the world, missing out wouldn’t be a worry. (Location 2035)

There’s a fable in Indian mythology that gets at this. A rich and powerful king wants to be immortal, and gets the gods to grant him a boon. But they don’t offer him immortality, just an insurance policy with explicit clauses. So he asks for and is granted, the following policy: he cannot be killed by day or night, by human or beast, neither indoors nor outdoors, and so forth. Clever, huh? And of course, he gets killed by a half-man-half-lion at dusk, on a doorstep. Talk about black swans. (Location 2044)

That’s why rich people (in my experience) are usually more careful with their money than poor people. Sure, they may splurge on luxuries (that’s their idea of rewarding themselves with a specific lifestyle), but that spending is just the spending on the lifestyle. They save the bulk of their wealth for increasingly complex forms of insurance to preserve those achieved lifestyles. The richer you get, the more lifestyle design becomes lifestyle insurance. (Location 2050)

A simple and stark motif for this is a soldier in the trenches of World War I. Imagine being this soldier. You are stuck in a boring, tedious, physically uncomfortable situation – cold, wet, eating terrible food, battling disease around you — all while dealing with ever-present death. Ask a simple question about this soldier: can this soldier engage in the most basic human relaxation behavior, taking a nap? Surprisingly, the answer is yes. Even under such extreme circumstances, you eventually hit a cognitive and physical limit and cannot devote any more intellectual resources to increasing your chances of winning and surviving. You hit a point where you let go, and take a nap. (Location 2075)

Whenever you are lucid, awake and thinking, you cannot escape the thought that the inevitability of death frames your current situation. It will frame your behaviors whether you realize it or not. The WWI soldier in the trench is always subconsciously alive to the fact that death is a careless stretch away. Whether he is smoking a cigarette, eating cold soup, or staring at a faded black and white picture of his kid, that thought is never far away. (Location 2087)

But just because there is always more you can do – and you should, it is the definition of being alive in a way – does not mean you cannot take a nap. (Location 2093)

Moral of the story: you can’t always pick your battles, but you can choose when, where, how and with whom to fight. Isolated tactical problems are very rare, and if you are seeing any situation as “how do I respond to this email” or “what do I say in this meeting,” chances are, you are misframing a broader problem and heading towards your personal Vietnam. (Location 2156)

Here’s the effective method: you need to interrupt as soon as you’ve roughly understood that there is an objectionable point being made (which can be before the speaker has finished making it), and before you’ve decided what to say. You do so by thinking out aloud, going “Aaaaaahhhhhhhhh!” or “Ehhhhummmmmm!” clearly, and stretching out your interrupt phrase over several seconds, until the interruptee shuts up and looks towards you. And most importantly, it should be patently clear that you haven’t yet decided what to say, and are thinking about it. This means looking up, down, or away in the distance as you normally would when you are absorbed in thought, not directly at the interruptee. Don’t try to stage this. An artificial use of this tactic will be transparent to smart people. You should actually start the interrupt at the real right time (based on the content of what’s being said, rather than the formation of your intention of “I need to stop this”), immediately tune out the room, and start shaping the response in your head. The quality of your timing will tell the other smart people in the room whether you know what you are doing, or faking it. (Location 2171)

By injecting enough subjective and emotion-laden information into a decision indirectly, you can make it impossible for others to question your right to make the call unilaterally.

Being inside an adversary’s tempo is all about wrangling luck to exploit habits. (Location 2254)

Real life is uncertain and messy for everybody, and an adversary is anyone who is trying to create better-than-random conditions for themselves by creating worse-than-random conditions for you, via the meta-game of rule-making and rule-breaking. To compete, you must do the same where necessary. (Location 2258)

To get inside the tempo of an adversary is to recognize and exploit the ways in which he or she (or it, in the case of organizations) is a creature of habit.

For the first law, in place of win-win or no-deal, I offer you: adult-adult or no deal. (Location 2296)

When you deal with adults, loyalty is not a value you have to apply but a budget you have to manage. In everyday life, you may never have to choose between a girlfriend and an idealistic politician as Batman was forced to, by the Joker, but you’re probably going to be disappointing people throughout your life. Managing how you spread the disappointment around is how you manage your loyalty budget. (Location 2300)

any loyalty you offer or accept has to be contingent but sincere. (Location 2303)

The third law of slightly evil loyalty: never be your own #1. (Location 2308)

what sort of stress would make you break promises to yourself? You will likely find that you won’t be putting yourself at the top of the list. (Location 2313)

To summarize: Adult-adult or no deal: don’t ask for, or offer, absolute loyalties Contingent but sincere: don’t play loyalty games Don’t be your own #1: it is easier to Be Slightly Evil on behalf of others (Location 2316)

But real life is about creating games, which means drawing your own boundaries, picking which rules to bend or break, and which rules to try and enforce. By creating a pattern of conflict through cooperation/competition/loyalty decisions, you’ve already drawn a boundary, and drawn people into the fray whether they want to play or not. (Location 2330)

Any set of rules of engagement that actually gets you and others moving from a state of situation-aware immobility in the face of such “chaoplexity” is a real-world game. Unlike formal games, real-world games can be understood as collisions between competing sets of rules of engagement, independently selected by the players. Sets of rules that can be arbitrarily and unilaterally changed as play progresses. (Location 2338)

The environment is a playing field where your self-imposed rules collide with the self-imposed rules of others, creating conflict. Unlike chess boards and football fields, the playing field for real-world games is some arbitrarily (and fuzzily) delineated area of volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity, with an open and leaky boundary. (Location 2347)

VUCA means the following: Volatility: there are no pure friends or enemies; most players you interact with are likely to be allies today, adversaries tomorrow and neutrals the day after. Uncertainty: it is hard to tell potential allies and adversaries apart at a fundamental level, because situations and optimal patterns of loyalty are fundamentally murky.. Complexity: Ever tried to diagram the set of who-hates-whom/who-likes-whom in the organization chart of a corporation? Intractable beyond about a dozen. Ambiguity: The environment is what it is. Ambiguity is a feature of your mental model of it, characterized by ifs, buts and maybes in your thinking about a situation. (Location 2354)

playing VUCA chess means being good at opening with both white and black pieces. You have to know how to be the decisive first-mover, and you have to know how to be a decisive fast-follower. (Location 2380)

Once somebody has precipitated action in a VUCA environment, you have to navigate an opening phase, where players jockey for position to define the rules. Next you have to learn to play the mid-game, after the system has lost its memory of the opening phase. And finally, you have to learn to script end-games, which, unlike in board games, are not a function of game-play rules, but conscious time to cash out/cut losses exit decisions. (Location 2383)

The Opening VUCA is a condition of noise waiting to be turned into information. When you choose to play white – be the first to act under VUCA – the key is to turn noise into signal, attract cooperation and delay or misdirect competition. (Location 2392)

So you have to discover a raw signal on one end (privileged market intelligence in a business context for example) that represents a prize worth fighting over, and send a refined version towards your allies (otherwise what value are you adding?) and a noisier version towards adversaries (amplified VUCA). (Location 2400)

The Mid-Game In the mid-game, the fog of indecision gets replaced by the fog of war. Instead of I don’t know what to do, you get I don’t know what the hell is going on. (Location 2423)

The key to the mid-game is to treat it as a fractal regime of sub-games and sub-sub-games. What prevents such dynamic mid-games from turning into stalemates is that the non-human part of the environment tends to keep changing, constantly undermining the assumptions underlying previous successes, and creating potential openings for changes in the leaderboard. (Location 2425)

habit is an efficient pattern of action dissociated from the logic that created it, and built around a fundamental desire or aversion. (Location 2433)

As a challenger who has temporarily acknowledged defeat on some front, what you need to do is create an opening to restart the competition. That means watching the environment more closely than the complacent adversary, spotting environmental changes earlier, figuring out what assumptions they undermine, and starting a subgame to take advantage. (Location 2443)

An alert adversary in a mid-game is a bundle of learned habits, both simple and complex, primed to respond faster and more instinctively to some threats than others. These are their strengths. They are also their push-button vulnerabilities. (Location 2448)

So if you can create a false signal that suggests a watched assumption is being undermined, you can exploit the absorption of limited attention on one front to open up another. You want a special kind of distraction to create instinctive fumbling driven by zemblanity rather than decisive responses: fear-uncertainty-doubt. FUD. (Location 2451)

There is an interesting psychological effect here known as inattentional blindness – the effect that allows somebody in a gorilla suit to run unnoticed across a basketball court with a game in progress. Because there is confusing but relatively legible action going on in one corner, you miss incomprehensible action elsewhere. Your attention locks onto things that it can process more easily into active situation awareness. (Location 2456)

Once you manage to create an opening and gain a foothold, you’ve created a sub-game the adversary cannot shut down immediately. Sub-games are similar to top-level games, but are more constrained by existing rules of engagement, and involve smaller wins. This is because there is already (Location 2464)

As the action develops, energy increasingly shifts to kinetic form, and each new sub-game wrinkle that develops has less potential energy – orientation potential – to draw on. VUCA turns into what is known as dynamic VUCA, or VUCA(D). We really ought to call it kinetic VUCA to emphasize the potential energy/kinetic energy analogy. (Location 2467)

End Games When everybody has all their energy fully committed to a set of ongoing games at multiple interconnected levels, you’re beyond both the fog of indecision and the fog of war. You’re entering the fog of exhaustion. (Location 2472)

In military thinking, this phase is often referred to as a melee, where there’s only energy left for instinctive action. You’ve learned all you’re going to learn. You’ve used up all the tricks you have. What’s left is energy and muscle memory. (Location 2477)

But as endgames get underway, zemblanity also has a natural tendency to take over the action, without artificial help. So endgames are naturally messy. (Location 2489)

The VUCA is changing flavor once again: from VUCA(D) to VUCA(E), E for entropy. (Location 2493)

And finally, I’ve also described it as a process of declining intelligence. From an opening phase of great cleverness, daring and imagination, where heroes are born, to a mid-game phase with increasing amounts of energy trapped in habits, to an end-game that’s mostly dumb energy, with very little intelligence and often no residual value: sound and fury signifying nothing. (Location 2501)

The phrase “inside the tempo” is appropriate because on the whole, partially adversarial situations drive up intelligence through open, Darwinian competition among competitors continuously getting inside each other’s heads by exploiting habits of thought. Mental models grow and strengthen all around, turning the latent truths of VUCA into the codified rules of a hierarchical complex of game play: a landscape of institutions. Landscapes of institutions extract wealth from the environment for a period of time before collapsing under their own weight, contributing to the primordial chaos from which new games can begin: the process of creative destruction. (Location 2506)

Without adversarial competition, we’d collectively spiral down into stupidity as a species. By racing against each other, we manage to collectively outrun the forces of entropy for a while. This is why, despite being a vegetarian who abhors unnecessary cruelty and pain, especially towards those who cannot protect themselves, I fundamentally don’t like the mind-atrophying idea of a permanent peace under conditions of permanent, unqualified abundance. Competition is ultimately the essence of life itself. To be slightly evil is to embrace life. (Location 2512)
