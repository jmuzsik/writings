The Fourth Way is a way of understanding, not of faith or obedience to a charismatic leader. As Mme. de Salzmann wrote, “The teaching is the guide, and only he who questions more deeply can be responsible to serve.” (Location 369)

For her the idea alone, the concept without experience, was not enough—truth could not be thought. Indeed, the knowledge of the thinking mind, especially thoughts about “who we are,” was an obstacle, a veil hiding reality. So, instead of presenting a vision of the ultimate destination, this book is more like an account of an actual journey, including routes traveled and landmarks encountered along the way.

According to Gurdjieff, the truth can be approached only if all the parts that make up the human being—the thought, the feeling and the body—are touched with the same force and in the particular way appropriate to each of them. (Location 440)

Sowing ideas without living them is sowing ideas that are empty. (Location 476)

All forcing comes from the ego. I must no longer be fooled by an image or an ideal that is imposed by the mind. I need to accept emptiness, accept to be nothing, accept “what is.” In this state, the possibility of a new perception of myself appears. (Location 556)

A conscious man is one who is always vigilant, always watchful, who remembers himself in both directions and has his two natures always confronted. (Location 697)

It is one complete act, an experience that can take place only if there is no separation between what sees and what is seen, no point from which the observation is made. Then there is a feeling of a special kind, a wish to know. (Location 742)

To observe without contradiction is like following a fast current, a torrent, anticipating the rushing water with one’s look, seeing the movement of each little wave. There is no time to formulate, to name or to judge. There is no more thinking. My mind becomes quiet and sensitive—very alive but quiet. It sees without distortion. Silent observation gives birth to understanding, but this truth must be seen. (Location 753)

I am here simply because I have been created. And I feel my life go by without any sense of direction, all the while suggestible, subject to what I hope, what I expect, what I have to do, what all this means. (Location 810)

I begin to see that real knowing is possible only in the moment when my attention is full, when consciousness fills everything. Then there are no distinctions—one thing is not more than another. There is pure existence. (Location 892)

I learn to purify my power of seeing, not by dismissing what is undesirable or turning away and settling on the agreeable. I learn to see everything without refusing the details. I learn to see clearly. I see that all things have the same importance, and I accept failure as good for me. I begin again a thousand times. Everything depends on this seeing. (Location 968)

In order to come to the total stillness in which I will be free to know, I must abandon both the pretension that I am able and my belief in what I know. I must see myself blindly believing, again and again, in what my thinking or my emotion tells me. I need to see myself always fooled until I feel the uselessness of it all, until I feel how poor I really am. Then a calm appears and perhaps I learn something new. In any case, it is like a door opening. All I can do is leave it open. What will follow I cannot foresee. (Location 1072)

The body has its repertoire of postures that imprison me. I have to find a position, inner and outer, that will free me from my attitudes and allow me to emerge from sleep, to open to another dimension, another world. (Location 1088)

My posture will be more stable if I am seated on the floor, on a cushion so that the knees are lower than the hips. One foot is placed, if possible, on the thigh or calf of the other leg. Crossing the legs checks the active impulse and allows the deepest level of quietude. The hands rest in the lap, the favored hand supporting the other, with palms up and thumbs touching. I sit absolutely straight, with the ears and shoulders in a vertical line. The eyes are slightly open or may be closed. If unable to sit on the floor, I can use a stool or chair provided I sit straight, with the knees lower than the hips. Maintaining the spine vertical frees pressure so that the upper part of the body feels no weight. (Location 1098)
