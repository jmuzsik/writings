# stuff from the awakening of intelligence

Knowledge is the past. And when he says he knows, he is thinking of some experience which he has had, which he has been able to recognise as something great, and that recognition is born out of his previous knowledge, otherwise he couldn’t recognise it, and therefore his experience has its roots in the past. Therefore it is not real. (Location 370)

Thought is always operating in the field of the known. Whether mechanical, non-verbal and so on, it is always working in the past. So my life is the past, because it is based on past knowledge, past experience, past memories, pleasure, pain, fear and so on—it is all the past. And the future I project from the past, thought projects from the past. So thought is fluctuating between the past and the future. (Location 650)

Now that state of “not knowing” is intelligence. Then it can operate in the field of the known and be free to work somewhere else if it wants to. (Location 681)

Can the mind, with all its content, empty itself and yet remain mind—not just float about? (Location 878)

There must be a relationship between the emptying of consciousness and the thing called love; between the unknown and the known, which is the content of consciousness. (Location 899)

The past images have no place. If you form an image, then you are related to it. (Location 931)

You can test it out by being totally aware during the day, watching your thoughts, your motives, your speech, the way you walk and talk. When you are so aware there are the intimations of the unconscious, of the deeper layers, because then you are exposing, inviting the hidden motives, the anxieties, the content of the unconscious to come into the open. (Location 1160)

when you take stock of the things that have happened during the day, then you are trying to bring about order before you go to sleep. And if you don’t make order before you go to sleep, the brain tries to do it when you are asleep. (Location 1166)

It is only when you try to change “what is” that there is disorder; because you want to change according to the knowledge which you have acquired. (Location 1177)

Surely thought is the response of memory, isn’t it?—memory as knowledge, memory as experience which has been accumulated, stored up in the brain cells. So the brain cells themselves are the cells of memory. (Location 1264)

Then if you see that, not verbally or intellectually—because that is not seeing—but when you actually realise that there is no division between the observer and the observed, between the thinker and the thought, then you see, then you observe actually “what is”. (Location 1297)

Because relationship means to be related—not in action, not in some project, not in an ideology—but to be totally united in the sense that the division, the fragmentation between individuals, between two human beings, does not exist at all at any level. (Location 1407)

How can there be relationship with another, if each one of us is pursuing his own personal achievement, his own personal success? (Location 1423)

To be related means not to be dependent on each other, not to escape from your loneliness through another, not to try to find comfort, companionship, through another. (Location 1460)

Can a mind and a heart that remembers the hurts, the insults, the things that have made it insensitive and dull—can such a mind and heart know what love is? (Location 1493)

That’s what you are, aren’t you? The remembrance of the failures, the hopes, the despairs, all that you are now, and that is going to be born in the next life—a lovely idea, isn’t it! (Location 1535)

Or you think there is a permanent soul, a permanent entity. (Location 1538)

So when you say there is something permanent, that permanency is the result of your thinking. (Location 1540)

One has to find out for oneself what it means to die; then there is no fear, therefore every day is a new day—and I really mean this, one can do this—so that your mind and your eyes see life as something totally new. That is eternity. That is the quality of the mind that has come upon this timeless state, because it has known what it means to die every day to everything it has collected during the day. Surely, in that there is love. Love is something totally new every day, but pleasure is not, pleasure has continuity. Love is always new and therefore it is its own eternity. (Location 1562)

To see together—which is sharing together—we must both of us see; not agree or disagree, but see together what actually is; not interpret it according to my conditioning or your conditioning, but see together what it is. And to see together one must be free to observe, one must be free to listen. That means to have no prejudice. Then only, with that quality of love, is there sharing. (Location 1617)

To look at that tree without knowledge, without the time-quality, does not mean identifying yourself with the tree, but to observe the tree so attentively, that the boundaries of time don’t come into it at all; the boundaries of time come in only when (Location 1654)

We are tired of them all, and the more one is sophisticated, intellectual, the more one wants to live only in the present—whatever that may mean—and invent a philosophy of the present. (Location 1698)

One has to investigate without any motive, without any purpose, the facts of time and if there is a timeless state. To enquire into that means to have no belief whatsoever, not to be committed to any religion, to any so-called spiritual organisation, not to follow any guru, and therefore to have no authority whatsoever—including that of the speaker especially. (Location 1722)

You don’t know what truth is, what God is—if there is such a thing—or what is a truly religious mind. You have read about it, people have talked about it for millennia, have built monasteries, but actually they are living on other people’s knowledge, experience and propaganda. To find out, surely one must put aside all that completely, and therefore the enquiry into all this is a very serious matter. (Location 1734)

Aloneness implies a mind that does not depend on another psychologically, is not attached to any person; which does not mean that there is no love—love is not attachment. Aloneness implies a mind that is deeply, inwardly without any sense of fear and therefore without any sense of conflict. (Location 1744)

But that order, that sense of moral rectitude, comes only when you understand the disorder, the confusion, the mess that one lives in. (Location 1765)

Thought can never be free in itself, it can talk about freedom, but in itself it is the result of past memories, experiences and knowledge; therefore it is old. (Location 1791)

That is the only thing the brain can do, to function in the field of experience, of knowledge in the field of time—which is the past. Meditation is to find out if there is a field which is not already contaminated by the known. (Location 1798)

It is only the still mind that understands that in a quiet mind there is a movement that is totally different, that is of a different dimension, of a different quality. That can never be put into words, because it is indescribable. (Location 1822)

But there is another kind of time, which we have accepted. That is, “Tomorrow I will be, tomorrow I will change, tomorrow I will become”; psychologically we have created time—tomorrow. (Location 1891)

That means to live, dying every day. Do it, and you will find out what it means to live completely today. (Location 1901)

The world outside of me is created by me—not the trees, not the clouds, the bees and the beauty of the landscape—but human existence in relationship, which is called society, that is created by you and by me. So the world is me and I am the world. (Location 1967)

The world being the society in which I live, with its culture, morality, inequality, all the chaos that is going on in society, that is myself in action. And the culture is what I have created and what I am caught in. (Location 1971)

We always want to alter the outer hoping thereby to change the inner. “Create the right environment”—the communists have said it a hundred times—“then the human mind will change according to that.” (Location 1977)

My consciousness is the world and the consciousness of the world is me. When there is a change in this consciousness it affects the whole consciousness of the world. (Location 2003)

To find out if there is something beyond this consciousness, I must understand the content of this consciousness. The mind must go beyond itself. Then I shall find out if there is something other than this or not. But to stipulate that there is has no meaning, it is just a speculation. (Location 2082)

And thought sees that there must be a change. This concrete entity, which is the result of thought, hopes to change the content. (Location 2192)

Now that fragment which we call superior, intelligence, intellect, reason, logic, is the product of the many other fragments. One fragment has assumed authority over other fragments. But it is still a fragment and therefore there is a battle between it and the many other fragments. (Location 2224)

Consciousness is its fragments and consciousness is the battle between the fragments. (Location 2282)

The Christians have personified evil as Satan and as an almost immutable force, almost equal to the good, almost equal to God. The Christians have enthroned evil almost eternally. (Location 2536)

So see what it means. Anything that is self-protective in the physical sense is not evil. But protecting oneself psychologically, resisting any movement, leads to disorder. (Location 2551)

Goodness implies total abnegation of the self. Because the “me” is always separative. The “me”, “my family”, the self, the person, the ego, is the centre of disorder, because it is a divisive factor. The “me” is the mind, is thought. And we have never been able to move away from this egocentric activity. To move completely away from it is complete order, freedom, goodness. And to remain in the circle of self-centred movement breeds disorder; there is always conflict there. (Location 2563)

The man who is the lowest reaches the middle. Swamiji: How? KRISHNAJI: By knocking. Life forces him, teaches him. There is war, hatred; he is destroyed. Or he goes into a church. The church is a trap to him. It does not enlighten him, it does not say, “For God’s sake break through,” but it says it will give him what he wants—entertainment, whether Jesus entertainment, or Hindu entertainment, or Buddhist, or Muslim or whatever it is—it will give him entertainment, only in the name of God. So they keep him at the same level, with little modifications, a little bit of polish, better culture, better clothes, etc. That is what is happening. He probably makes up (as you said just now) eighty per cent of the world, more perhaps, ninety per cent. Swamiji: What can you do? KRISHNAJI: I won’t add to it, I won’t tell him stories, I won’t entertain him; because there are others who are already entertaining him. (Location 2677)

Obviously, what else, Sir? Look at what is going on in the study of behaviour. They say outward circumstances, environment, culture, produce certain types of behaviour. That is, if I live in a communist environment with its domination, with its threats, concentration camps, all that will make me behave in a certain way; I put on a mask, frightened, and I behave in a certain way. In a society which is more or less free, where there are not so many rules, because nobody believes in rules, where everything is permitted, there I play. (Location 2800)
