- I said before the Eagles friend is not a part of you. Because the ego perceives itself at war and therefore in need of allies. You who are not at war with look for brothers and recognise all whom you see as brothers because oh, Equals or at peace, because God's equal sons have everything you cannot compete. Yet if they perceive and interpret as anything other than their perfect equals the idea of competition as entering their minds, do not underestimate your need to be vigilant against this idea because all your conflicts come from it is the belief that conflicting interests are powerful and therefore you have accepted them possible as true. Is that different from saying you perceive yourself as unreal
- you cannot forget the father because I am with you, and I cannot forget him. To forget me is to forget yourself and the human who created me, while others are forgetful. That is why they need you remembrance of me and of Him who created me do this. Remember, you can change their minds about themselves and I can change yours.
- Your mind is so powerful light that you can look into theirs and enlighten them as I can. enlighten yours, I want to share my mind with you because we are of one mind and that mind is ours. See only in this mind everywhere because only this is everywhere and everything. It is everything because it encompasses all things within itself. blessing, blessing or you can perceive only this because you receive only what is true.
- You are the will of God. do not accept anything else as your will or you are denying what you are denying this deny this and you will attack believing you have been attacked. But see the love of God in you and you will see it everywhere because it is everywhere. See his abundance in everyone and you will know you are in him with them. They are part of you as you are part of God. You're as lonely without understanding this as God Himself is lonely when his sons do not know. The peace of god is understanding this there was only one way out of the world's thinking. Just as there was only one way into it, understand totally, by understanding totality.
- The Holy Spirit will teach you to perceive beyond your belief, because truth is beyond belief and his his perception is true. The ego can be completely forgotten at any time, because it is totally in it is a totally incredible belief and no one can keep a belief he is judged to be unbelievable. The more you learn about the ego, the more you realise that it cannot be believed incredible cannot be understood because it is unbelievable. The meaninglessness of perception based on the unbelievable is apparent,
- but it may not be recognised as being being beyond belief because because it is made By the leaf extension of God's being his spirits only function its fullness cannot be contained any more than the fullness of its creator. fullness is extension the egos whole dog system blocks extension that is endless blocks your only function if therefore blocks your jewellery so that you perceive yourself as unfulfilled unless you create you are unfulfilled, but God does not know unfulfillment and therefore you must create. You may not know your own creations, but this can no more interfere with their reality than your unawareness of your spirit can interfere with its me.
- The Holy Spirit's teaching takes only one direction and there's only one goal. His direction is freedom and his goal is God. Yet he cannot conceive of God without cubicles. It is not God's will to be without you. When you have learned that your will is God you could no more will to be without him than he could will to be without you. This is freedom and this is freedom as joy, deny yourself this and you're denying God His kingdom because He created you for this.
- The goal of the curriculum regardless of the teacher you choose is Know thyself. There is nothing else to seek. Everyone is looking for himself and for the power and glory he thinks he has lost. Whenever you are with anyone, you have another opportunity to find them. Your power and glory are in him because they are the Eagles tries to find them in yourself only because it does not know where to look. The Holy Spirit teaches you that if you look only at yourself you cannot find yourself because that is not what you are. Whenever you are with a brother, you are learning what you are because you are teaching what you are. You respond either with pain or with joy and depending on which teacher you are following, you will be imprisoned or at least according to your decision. And so will you never forget your responsibility to him because it is your responsibility to yourself. Give him his place in the kingdom and you will have yours. I am come as a light into the world that does deny itself everything. It does this simply by dissociated itself from everything. It is therefore in the illusion of isolation maintained Fear of the same loneliness that is its illusion. I said that I am always with you. Even until the end of the world that is why I am the light of the world. If I am with you in the loneliness of the world, the loneliness is gone. You cannot maintain the illusion of loneliness if you are not alone. My purpose then is still to overcome the world. I do not attack it, but my light must dispel it because of what it is. Light does not attack darkness, but it does shine in the way if my light goes with you anywhere, everywhere. You shine it away with me. The light becomes ours and you cannot abide darkness any more than darkness can abide wherever you go. Do remembrance of me is remembrance of yourself and of Him who sent me to you
- Nothing God created can oppose your decision as nothing God created can oppose His will. God gave you will its power which I can only acknowledge in honour of his. If you want to be like me, I will help you. Knowing that we are like if you want it to be different, I will wait until you change your mind. I can teach you but only you can choose to listen to my teaching. How else can it be? If God's kingdom is freedom, equality, freedom cannot be learned by tyrant and can the perfect equality of all God's sons cannot be recognised. Through the dominion of one mind over another. God's sons are equally will or being the will of their father. This is the only lesson I came to teach
- "I Think I see a fearful world, a dangerous world, a hostile world, a sad world, a wicked world, a crazy world."
- "But I am upset because I see a meaningless world."
  - The basic idea is that the world is neither good or bad. All that is is neither good or bad. So there is no reason to be upset.
- A meaningless world engenders fear.
  - "Actually a meaningless world is impossible. Nothing without meaning exists."
  - "It is essential... that you learn to recognize the meaningless, and accept it without fear."
  - A meaningless world engenders fear because I think I am in competition with God.
- God did not create a meaningless world.
  - This is "...the reason why a meaningless world is impossible. What God did not create does not exist. And everything that does exist exists as He created it. The world you see has nothing to do with reality. It is of your own making, and it does not exist."
  - "This is your personal repertory of horrors at which you are looking. These things are part of the world you see. Some of them are shared illusions, and others are part of your personal hell."
- My thoughts are images that I have made.
  - "It is because the thoughts you think you think appear as images that you do not recognize them as nothing. You think you think them and so you think you see them. This is how your 'seeing' was made."
  - "You will begin to understand it when you have seen little edges of light around the same familiar objects which you see now."
- I have no neutral thoughts
  - "The idea for today is a beginning step in dispelling the belief that your thoughts have no effet. Everything you see is the result of your thoughts. There is no exception to this fact. Thoughts are not big or little; powerful or weak. They are merely true or false. Those that are true create their own likeneess. Those that are false make theirs."
  - "This thought about **\_\_\_** is not a neutral thought."
    - Not sure what meaning to ascertain. It relates to the idea that my thoughts, whatever they may be affect me. Each little thought has a certain power over me that I must find a way to understand. Only through this being aware of the thoughts that go through my brain am I able to overcome delusions or other wasteful parts of myself.
- I see no neutral things.
  - "I see no neutral things because I have no neutral thoughts."
    - I do not see a neutral **\_**, bcause my thoughts about \_\_\_\_ are not neutral.
      - **\_** = technology, religion, love, etc.
- I am not alone in experiencing the effects of my seeing.
  - The idea for today is another step in learning that the thoughts which give rise to what you see are never neutral or unimportant. I also emphasizes the idea that minds are joined...
    - I am not alone in experiencing the effects of how I see friendship.
    - I am not alone in experiencing the effects of how I see beauty
    - I am not alone in experiencing the effects of how I see comfort
    - I am not alone in experiencing the effects of my seeing
- I am determined to see
  - The exercises for today consist in reminding yourself throughout the day that you want to see. Today's idea also tacitly implies the recognition that you do not see now. Therefore, as you repeat the idea, you are stating that you are determined to change your present state for a better one, and one you really want.
