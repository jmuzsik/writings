Austin Kleon puts it perfectly in his book Show Your Work (affiliate link):
“Become a documentarian of what you do. Start a work journal: Write your thoughts down in a notebook, or speak them into an audio recorder. Keep a scrapbook. Take a lot of photographs of your work at different stages in your process. Shoot video of you working. This isn’t about making art, it’s about simply keeping track of what’s going on around you. Take advantage of all the cheap, easy tools at your disposal—these days, most of us carry a fully functional multimedia studio around in our smartphones…Once a day, after you’ve done your day’s work, go back to your documentation and find one little piece of your process that you can share.”

Riding the Writing Wave: How to Improve Your Writing, Get Rid of Writer’s Block, and Accelerate Your Output by David Perell

https://fortelabs.co/blog/riding-the-writing-wave-how-to-improve-your-writing-get-rid-of-writers-block-and-accelerate-your-output/

Make writing a daily habit. A day where you don’t write anything is the enemy of productivity. Days when you don’t write anything are the enemy of productivity. The most important thing: write something every day — no matter what.

The 10-Step Writing Process:
Step 1: Create a Mega Outline
Step 2: Build an Archipelago of Ideas
Step 3: Outline
Step 4: Write a 2nd Rough Draft
Step 5: Re-Write Every Sentence
Step 6: 10–15 Sentence Article Summary
Step 7: Send to Friends and Ask for Feedback
Step 8: Write a 3rd Rough Draft
Step 9: Turn outline into a full post
Step 10: Publish

Use TK: As you’re writing, put “TK” anywhere you aren’t sure of a detail, or where you need to add more context later. One of the main reasons I stop writing or fall out of flow is getting stuck on some detail giving me trouble, and by dropping in a TK to come back to it later, I can maintain the flow. Why TK? Think of it as “To Come.” That letter combination doesn’t appear in any English word, so when you CMD+F for it after you’re done writing, you’ll only find the instances where you used it as a place marker.
When in Doubt, Delete It: The easiest way to deal with almost anything giving you trouble is to delete it. If a sentence is bugging you, delete it. Awkward paragraph, delete it. Confusing section, delete it. You’ll find you never needed it in the first place.
Context Switch: If you can, try editing in a few different contexts, the more varied, the better. Do one round of edits standing at the desk you work from, then do another at a bar after a glass of wine or two. Looking at a piece in different places in different mental states will help you see it differently and develop a more varied voice throughout the piece. You may find, too, that when you look at it in a different context, you think of other material to include you hadn’t thought of before.

Theory of Constraints 104: Balance Flow, Not Capacity - Forte Labs by fortelabs.co
https://fortelabs.co/blog/theory-of-constraints-104-balance-flow-not-capacity/

The principles of flow imply a management philosophy: no company should take on more work than their bottleneck can process. The job of management is to determine the capacity of their bottleneck, fill it, and then allow no more projects to begin until one is completed.
In other words, for even one part of a system to be fully utilized (the bottleneck), every other part must have excess capacity. This is in direct contradiction to the universal rule of the modern workplace: “everyone stay busy,” otherwise known as “use all available capacity.” Which is why Goldratt described this as perhaps the single greatest paradigm change required of management in adopting the Theory of Constraints.

Theory of Constraints 103: The Four Fundamental Principles of Flow - Forte Labs by fortelabs.co
https://fortelabs.co/blog/theory-of-constraints-103-the-four-fundamental-principles-of-flow/

Ford is remembered today mostly for Model Ts and pithy quotes, but his real contribution was the discovery of the Four Fundamental Principles of Flow:
Optimizing flow: The primary objective of operations is to improve flow (also known as throughput, defined as revenue minus marginal costs)

Non-production: The key to improving flow is establishing a practical mechanism to determine when not to produce

Abolishing local optima: Local efficiencies (better known today as “local optima”) must be abolished

Focusing process: Improvement must be guided using a focusing process, directed to where it will make the biggest difference at any given time

Using the mechanism of time allowed the principles of flow to be applied far beyond the world of manufacturing — to project-based environments, to sales and marketing, to retail and services, and eventually, to software development.

In all these creative fields, work moves not through the sequential, linear flow of an assembly line, but the even more rigid, even more linear flow of time.

Email Boss: My Top Learnings From an Online Course Accelerator - Forte Labs by fortelabs.co
https://fortelabs.co/blog/email-boss-my-top-learnings-from-an-online-course-accelerator/

We learned a number of other strategies for helping prospects through the stages they naturally go through in their journey. For example:
Trusted Advisor: positioning yourself as a trusted advisor in their decision-making process

Infotainment: teaching and entertaining at the same time as you are selling

Superhero Character: creating a heightened version of your true self that they can look to as a role model

Mentor Story: telling the story of how you had a mentor to get where you are, and that therefore they should have a mentor, which is you

Signature System: a proprietary name or term that sets your system apart from generic ones
But all these tactics rest on the foundation of a trusted relationship between you and your subscribers. Tactics don’t work on uninformed buyers. They only work when they already know about and value what you’re offering. It is 7–10 times easier to convert an existing customer versus a new one. Which means you should invest in a long-term relationship with every person who signs up to your list.

Here is an example of just a small selection of beliefs that are in the “chain” for my Building a Second Brain course:
Your brain is for having ideas, not holding them

You are already creative and do creative work

Your thoughts and ideas are valuable and worth saving and revisiting

You are already doing most of the work required

You can get and stay organized quickly and easily

If you don’t make an intentional effort to preserve your thinking, it will be lost

Do you see how each of these beliefs is absolutely necessary for someone to even consider buying my course? They can believe the course is the best thing in the world, but if they don’t believe that “My brain is for having ideas, not holding them,” then what I’m offering won’t make sense. They can think having a Second Brain is the niftiest idea they’ve ever heard, but it will remain only a “nice to have” unless they believe that “If I don’t make an intentional effort to preserve my thinking, it will be lost.”

But Billy told me something that served as a wake up call: unless you can accurately describe the problem people are facing, they won’t trust you to provide the solution. It makes perfect sense. Would you trust a tennis coach who couldn’t seem to understand why your backhand was so challenging? Would you trust a doctor who couldn’t seem to come up with a proper diagnosis?

I’ve been a big advocate over the years for more people to create online courses. It is truly wonderful work to do, combining the satisfaction of helping people change their lives with the flexibility of location independence with the profitability of near-zero marginal costs with the scale of online distribution.

PARA Part 8: Core Principles of Digital Organization - Forte Labs by fortelabs.co
https://fortelabs.co/blog/p-a-r-a-viii-core-principles/

Over the past year, I’ve seen P.A.R.A. implementations of all shapes and sizes. I’ve seen them from every corner of the globe, in languages I don’t even recognize, in at least a dozen different programs, and both digital and physical forms.

Over that time, eight core principles seem to have emerged as fundamental features. Whether you’ve taken on the particularities of the system I’ve described in this series, adopting these principles will seriously upgrade your digital organization.

Here they are, in no particular order:
Organize by actionability

Organize opportunistically

Move quickly, touch lightly

Controlled randomness

Complex systems have to be grown, not made

Focus on outcomes

Fail gracefully

Shallow hierarchies

This is a variant of Gall’s Law, which states that “all complex systems that work evolved from simpler systems that worked.” In other words, you can’t design a complex system from scratch and expect it to work. Complex systems have to be grown slowly over time, because their interdependencies and variables are too complex to guess correctly the first time.

The promise of P.A.R.A. is that it makes “getting organized” a straightforward affair to get over with as quickly as possible. My wish is that the smart, creative people of the world spend less time behind their computer screens, and more time taking direct action in the world. We need people who are empowered and propelled forward by their creative process, not consumed by it. Our talents and knowledge are sorely needed in the real world.

PARA Part 6: Small-Batch Projects for Focus, Creativity, and Perspective - Forte Labs by fortelabs.co
https://fortelabs.co/blog/p-a-r-a-part-vi-small-batch-projects-for-focus-creativity-and-perspective/

In his wide-ranging book on the nature of satisfaction, Gregory Berns came to a startlingly simple conclusion: “I have come to understand novelty as the one thing that we all want.”

Small-batch projects promote a different set of habits that benefit from novelty, instead of being threatened by it. These are habits more expansive and powerful than your daily routine: constantly moving into zones of greater leverage; transferring momentum from one project to another; designing projects so they are more than the sum of their parts; timing projects to take advantage of external events. These are the dark arts of productivity. “Dark” only because so few have access to the project throughput required to practice them.

5 Things I Learned From the Anti-Book Club - Forte Labs by fortelabs.co
https://fortelabs.co/blog/5-things-i-learned-from-the-anti-book-club/

The idea is simple: instead of everyone in the group reading the same book, duplicating time and effort, we each read a different book on the same topic. Then each person summarizes the book they read, and I compile and share the summaries with everyone who contributed.

Time Budgeting: What I've Learned From Doing 364 Weekly Reviews - Forte Labs by fortelabs.co
https://fortelabs.co/blog/time-budgeting-what-ive-learned-from-doing-364-weekly-reviews/

There is an important idea in personal finance, that you should “age” your money.

The “age” of your money is important because it represents your buffer between income and expenses. If you only have one week of buffer (i.e. your age of money is only 7 days), it means that if you get fired tomorrow, you’ll only have one week before you start going hungry. Your age of money is your real-time financial reserve, measured in terms of time.

Framing your tasks as potential options means that the larger your To Do list grows, the more freedom you have. Your freedom to do what you feel like doing, to do what aligns with your energy and motivation. You gain the ability to step back from the minute-to-minute demands, look for patterns across your full range of tasks, and choose groups of to do’s that are strategically aligned with each other.

The truth is, the future doesn’t exist. At least not yet. It might turn out one way or another. But your control over that future is rooted in the here and now. If you can’t manage the work-in-process that exists now, what makes you think you will be successful in managing the work yet to come?

But once you’ve mastered these rules, you start to see that no rule is absolute. Every rule is one manifestation of an underlying principle. And principles always have more than one way they can be manifested.

Design your work book

Attention is a skill — if you don’t cultivate it, it will atrophy (Location 287)

80% of happiness is just paying attention (Location 297)

Paying attention to something takes away its power (Location 321)

Jason Silva says, “Imagination allows us to conceive of delightful future possibilities, pick the most amazing one, and pull the present forward to meet it.” (Location 502)

5. Collective consciousness is both our greatest hope, and our greatest fear (Location 637)

Study after study tells us exactly what we need to be happy, regardless of time, culture, age, or personality — intimate social relationships. So why is happiness so hard to find? Because relationships involve likely short-term risks and uncertain long-term rewards. Like the characters in the grandest space opera, we have to leave our comfort zone to find fulfillment, even if our “spaceship” is just a desk. (Location 660)

When a critical fraction of nodes [or habits] is removed the network becomes fragmented into small, disconnected clusters. (Location 882)

One cluster can fail without affecting the others. This phenomenon is called percolation and it represents an order-disorder type of phase transition with critical exponents (Location 885)

Dependencies may lead to cascading failures… and a relatively small failure can lead to a catastrophic breakdown of the system (Location 890)

Speaking with a friend recently, she pointed out that with most of our childhood memories, we don’t actually retain the original experiential memory — instead, we have a “memory of having the memory,” reinforced and probably altered over years of retelling and reminiscing. (Location 1113)

We learned in the New York Times recently that storing a single human brain’s connectome (the complete map of all neurons and the interconnections between them) would take half the planet’s digital storage capacity: 1.3 billion terabytes. In other words, to store just a static map of the physical brain structure of two individuals would require 100% of global storage capacity. (Location 1146)

We only have the roughest idea of what that would require, but last year the world’s 4th most powerful supercomputer took 40 minutes to simulate just 1 second of 1% of a brain’s activity. So, we’re not even close. (Location 1153)

creativity is connecting things, especially things that don’t seem to be connected. (Location 1169)

Eddie Opara writes in The Atlantic, describing his research scanning the brains of highly accomplished creatives, “creative people are better at recognizing relationships, making associations and connections…” (Location 1170)

“You have to keep a dozen of your favorite problems constantly present in your mind, although by and large they will lay in a dormant state. Every time you hear or read a new trick or a new result, test it against each of your twelve problems to see whether it helps. Every once in a while there will be a hit, and people will say, “How did he do it? He must be a genius!” (Location 1213)

Even when we do invest the time, we usually don’t create notes that can be re-used and recycled in other projects. We don’t know what we know, because this information, which we’ve spent precious time and attention to absorb, remains disconnected, fragmented, and scattered. The seeds of insight hide in mysteriously titled folders and documents, opaque black boxes floating in the cloud. (Location 1234)

Cal Newport says, “knowledge workers dedicate too much time to shallow work — tasks that almost anyone, with a minimum of training, could accomplish.” (Location 1248)

“We need to spend more time engaged in deep work — cognitively demanding activities that leverage our training to generate rare and valuable results.” (Location 1252)

Because defending a perspective takes ammunition. And by ammunition, I mean examples, illustrations, stories, statistics, diagrams, analogies, metaphors, photos, mindmaps, conversation notes, quotes, book notes — these are the kinds of things you should be capturing. (Location 1267)

use resonance as your criteria. As in, “that resonates with me.” (Location 1282)

Often, when something “resonates” with us, it is our intuitive/right brain/System 1 mind telling us something is valuable before our analytical/left brain/System 2 mind even knows what’s going on. (Location 1286)

What makes one note more valuable than another? (Location 1326)

The Wikipedia article on systems thinking explains why soft systems are preferable to hard systems in this situation. Soft systems are ideal for: “Systems involving people holding multiple and conflicting frames of reference. (Location 1355)

And for “…understanding motivations, viewpoints, and interactions.” (Location 1359)

The value of a note corresponds to how much attention you’ve spent on it (Location 1385)

layer of compression (saving any notes on the source): 50% 2 layers (bolding the best parts): 25% 3 layers (highlighting the very best parts): 20% (Location 1456)

4 layers or more (restating the ideas in my own words, applying them to my own context, creating summary outlines, etc.): 5% or less (Location 1460)

As David Allen says, Simple, clear purposes and principles give rise to complex and intelligent behavior. Complex rules and regulations give rise to simple and stupid behavior. (Location 1485)

You’ll find yourself picking out 2 sentences from a long article, whose relevance is only apparent to someone with your life experiences and “dozen favorite problems.” (Location 1494)

Digital notes are the new marginalia — the personal musings and insights of a unique mind — extracted from paper and indexed for maximum searchability. (Location 1496)

the power of self-narratives: (Location 1543)

Richard Hamming put it this way: “I notice that if you have the door to your office closed, you get more work done today and tomorrow, and you are more productive than most. But 10 years later somehow you don’t quite know what problems are worth working on… He who works with the door open gets all kinds of interruptions, but he also occasionally gets clues as to what the world is and what might be important. … [T]here is a pretty good correlation between those who work with the doors open and those who ultimately do important things, although people who work with doors closed often work harder.” That is next-level productivity right there. (Location 1553)

An article in the Harvard Business Review puts a name to this neurological phenomenon: Attention Deficit Trait. Basically, the terms ADD and ADHD are falling out of use because effectively the entire population fits the diagnostic criteria. It’s not a condition anymore; it’s a trait — the inherent and unavoidable experience of modern life characterized by “distractibility, inner frenzy, and impatience.” (Location 1593)

Affordance (n.): a relation between an object and an organism that, through a collection of stimuli, affords the opportunity for that organism to perform an action. (Location 1644)

David Allen puts it this way: “It’s practical to have organized reading material at hand when you’re on your way to a meeting that may be starting late, a seminar that may have a window of time when nothing is going on, a dentist appointment that may keep you waiting, or, of course, if you’re going to have some time on a train or plane. Those are all great opportunities to browse and work through that kind of reading. People who don’t have their Read/Review material organized can waste a lot of time, since life is full of weird little windows when it could be used.” You’re (Location 1674)

Remove any feature, process, or effort that does not directly contribute to the learning you seek. — Eric Ries, The Leader’s Guide (Location 1741)

As the inimitable Venkatesh Rao has written, we’re moving from a world of containers (companies, departments, semesters, packages, silos) to a world of streams (social networks, info feeds, main streets of thriving cities, Twitter). Problems and opportunities alike resist having neat little boxes drawn around them. There’s way too much to absorb. Way too much to even (Location 1777)

proposes is “exposing yourself to as many different diverse streams as possible.” When you’re immersed in a stream, the faster it goes, the more novel perspectives and ideas you’re exposed to. (Location 1787)

People who cling to paradigms (which means just about all of us) take one look at the spacious possibility that everything they think is guaranteed to be nonsense and pedal rapidly in the opposite direction. Surely there is no power, no control, no understanding, not even a reason for being, much less acting, in the notion or experience that there is no certainty in any worldview. But, in fact, everyone who has managed to entertain that idea, for a moment or for a lifetime, has found it to be the basis for radical empowerment. If no paradigm is right, you can choose whatever one will help to achieve your purpose. It is in this space of mastery over paradigms that people throw off addictions, live in constant joy, bring down empires, get locked up or burned at the stake or crucified or shot, and have impacts that last for millennia. In the end, it seems that mastery has less to do with pushing leverage points than it does with strategically, profoundly, madly letting go. (Location 1805)

1. Archive (“e” shortcut) immediately This will be probably 60–70% of all messages, as they are basically notifications that just need a quick glance. 2. Reply (“r” shortcut), then archive You can also optionally create a reminder as in #4 below, in case it falls through the cracks and you need to follow up. 3. Add to calendar, then archive You can paste the link to the email in the calendar entry if needed, but this is unnecessary with Google invites, and a quick search will turn up the original email if needed anyway. 4. Create a task (“add task” shortcut), then archive Hit the keyboard shortcut for the task manager you’re using, write out the task associated with the message (with a link back to this email inserted automatically, as shown in the screenshots of Things and Todoist above), and then archive the email. (Location 2091)

Remember that there is only one important time and it is Now. The present moment is the only time over which we have dominion. — Leo Tolstoy (Location 2116)

David Allen, in the 2015 revision of Getting Things Done, describes the long-term path to GTD Mastery: “…optimally taking advantage of self-created contexts and triggers to produce creative ideas, perspectives, and actions that wouldn’t normally occur.” (Location 2236)

Josh Waitzkin, in The Art of Learning: “In performance training, first we learn to flow with whatever comes. Then we learn to use whatever comes to our advantage. Finally, we learn to be completely self-sufficient and create our own earthquakes, so our mental process feeds itself explosive inspirations without the need for outside stimulus.” (Location 2240)

this Scientific American article describe studies showing that unusually creative people are characterized by “their ability to mix seemingly incompatible states of being depending on the task, whether it’s open attention with a focused drive, mindfulness with daydreaming, intuition with rationality, intense rebelliousness with respect for tradition, etc.” (also called “blends of emotions”). (Location 2249)

Instead of forcing all of them — past, present, and future — to line up with an unchanging predetermined outcome (a “mission” or “purpose”), it makes more sense to start with what excites your current self right now, and then work from there to define that motivation in increasingly subtle shades over time. (Location 2307)

“A visual model becomes one of the most effective tools for minimizing alignment-attrition; a visualization formalizes an emergent idea and solidifies it at a moment in time.” (Location 2341)

complex. States of mind are a better guide to modern work than values (which don’t always motivate), goals (which often change), and processes (which try to prescribe the unprescribable) precisely because moods are the only things that change just as fast as the world around us. (Location 2372)

Joseph Campbell: “People say that what we’re all seeking is a meaning for life,…[but] I think that what we’re seeking is an experience of life, so that our life experiences on the purely physical plane will have resonances with our own innermost being and reality, so that we actually feel the rapture of being alive.” (Location 2388)

“Employees work just enough to not be fired, and employers pay them just enough to not quit.” (Location 2407)

Cubicle farms have given way to vast open floor plans, (Location 2437)

But the truth is, both this “new” philosophy and the “old” philosophy that preceded it share that same old core assumption: that the interests of employees and employers are fundamentally opposed. They are both an attempt to induce a certain kind of output with the right “mix” of external cues and explicit rewards. You only feel the need to induce something if you don’t believe it will arise naturally. (Location 2439)

equation: instead of work being the common ground between companies and employees, employees must be seen as the common ground between companies and work. (Location 2457)

It acknowledges that companies don’t have a purpose; they aren’t innovative; they don’t even exist — people do. (Location 2462)

The purpose of companies is to build a culture that supports their people. (Location 2466)

The job of employees is to use that culture as a platform to perform their work as productively and creatively as possible. (Location 2469)

The purpose of the work is to serve as a vehicle for learning and personal growth for each employee, however they define it. (Location 2475)

Work is a constant source of new challenges to feed people’s hunger for learning Work provides a stream of opportunities for people to inject their creativity and judgment into the process (self-expression), resulting in a greater sense of accomplishment (self-affirmation) Work provides a forum for visible accomplishments, critical for social learning, status, and prestige. Work can provide the freedom to make decisions and prove one’s self-sufficiency, which is important to self-worth Work can provide a voyage of exploration (a “career”) while mitigating many of its risks (self-discovery) The cycle culminates in employees’ ultimate contribution to the company: sustainable, long-term innovation. (Location 2483)

Innovation is an emergent phenomenon, arising unpredictably from the interactions between the building blocks of culture, productivity, and personal growth. (Location 2501)

The purpose of leaders is to preserve and refine this alignment, to help people align with their work, and the company to align with its people. (Location 2509)

The results are common across all big, centralized projects in the modern world: massive cost overruns, extended delays, failed launches, damaging unintended consequences, and broken, unusable systems. These failures don’t happen despite planning and prediction, they happen because of them. They happen because we insist on planning and predicting a world that is no longer predictable. (Location 2535)

Immersion means intentionally exposing yourself to streams of ideas, people, and new capabilities, not with the goal of knowing everything, but to stay sensitized to developing opportunities and threats. The faster the stream goes, the more ideas and information you get exposed to. (Location 2560)

Experimentation recognizes that our technological, networked world presents us with quickly falling downsides (for example, the cost of starting a business, or the costs of failure), as well as rapidly expanding upsides (opportunities to reach more people in less time than ever before). (Location 2563)

More experimentation leads to more failure, but that’s actually a good thing: the faster you fail, the faster you learn, because it is usually faster and cheaper to learn from failure than to attempt to anticipate and plan for every single thing that could go wrong. (Location 2567)

Leverage is the ability to rapidly shift resources to new, more fruitful directions. This ability becomes paramount when the best path forward cannot be predicted, and even when you find it, it can change quickly and unexpectedly. (Location 2569)

A formal definition of a stream is an “open, non-hierarchical flow of real-time information from multiple overlapping networks.” (Location 2580)

a stream is “a life context formed by all the information flowing towards you via a set of trusted connections — to free people, ideas and resources — from multiple networks, both technological and not.” (Location 2584)

Think of the main streets of a thriving city. Commercial networks overlap with transport networks, political networks, family networks, friendship networks, environmental networks, etc. All these networks not only coexist, but actually enhance each other, constantly presenting unrelated people, ideas, and resources in unexpected juxtapositions. (Location 2586)

This is sometimes called the “luck of networks” — by increasing the size and scope of the network, you make your own luck. (Location 2610)

We can define “tinkering” as trial-and-error, iterative improvement. It is testing and adaptation designed to uncover unexpected new opportunities, without fixed goals. (Location 2618)

“collaboration” — it is a mechanism for averaging and combining the interestingness instincts of people with diverse backgrounds and skills, in the hope that it will lead to profitable opportunities that no one would find on their own. (Location 2627)

opt-in staffing of projects (allowing people to choose their work based on what interests them), promiscuous forking (creating parallel versions of a project to allow them to evolve in different directions), and teams drawn from across roles, functions, and departments (to combine different flavors of curiosity). (Location 2629)

“How can leaders facilitate decision making without stifling the randomness essential to breakthrough ideas?” (Location 2651)

As our time horizon moves closer and closer, it makes more sense to do the reverse: define next steps clearly, while deliberately leaving the long-term vision as fuzzy as possible. (Location 2653)

Gall’s Law, from the study of complex systems: “A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch never works” (Location 2670)

You may have wondered what the title of this series, “Breaking Smart,” refers to. My interpretation is that this new approach to problem solving implies a radical shift: being smart is no longer about raw brainpower, or having all the answers. We are “breaking “the definition of “smart.” (Location 2678)

The smartest way to solve a problem is no longer to attack it directly. Problems are too complex, interconnected, and chaotic to yield to brute force attack. You have to create a network to defeat a network. (Location 2693)

Luck may seem a strange thing to depend on for business or professional success. Luckily, you can make your own luck to a certain degree, by making your information and your organization as transparent, searchable, and hackable (in the productive sense) as possible. (Location 2699)

The best way to surf the stream, it seems, is to become part of the stream. (Location 2703)

If it operates even partly on the assumption that people can change, period, the “takeaway advice” won’t seek to merely change your thoughts or beliefs. It will seek to change what you DO. (Location 2715)

Thus the current thinking on behavior change is that it boils down to habit formation. I’ll call this theory Neo-Pavlovian Behaviorism (NPB), a throwback to Pavlov and his salivating dogs. (Location 2721)

mental models — I believe are the key to understanding not only academic theories of behavior change, but also how to cause it on the level of a single individual. (Location 2734)

Scientists denounce it with unusually strong words: “Arguably no other notable figure in history was so fantastically wrong about nearly every important thing he had to say” than Sigmund Freud, the philosopher Todd Dufresne says. Nobel (Location 2739)

Even if you reject all of Freud’s specific claims and conclusions, his basic premise — that we are driven by deep, conflicting forces that must be controlled or satiated — lived on through his nephew, evolving to underpin modern consumerism. (Location 2754)

People tend to choose difficult goals, like going on a run every morning, meditating an hour per day, or studying a new language every evening. They choose these sexy-sounding, impressive habits as a way of maximizing the initial boost of energy and excitement that most rely on to get started. The problem with continuing to rely on sustained momentum is that any hiccup or missed day is interpreted as a failure. High stakes means, sooner or later, a long way to fall. (Location 2779)

Small Wins is the technique of replacing this binary win/loss outcome with a series of progressively easier versions of the habit. (Location 2783)

The goal is to overcome “introspection illusion” — the (often mistaken) assumption that we understand our own motives and fears. (Location 2803)

The point here is that personal mental models are not incidental, or purely theoretical. The model you use to understand a given change powerfully influences the outcome. (Location 2806)

Voluminous research has shown that willpower is like a muscle — using it too much makes it tired, leading to poor performance and poor choices. Equally voluminous research indicates that willpower is unlimited, or actually increases with use, or depends on your beliefs about the nature of willpower. (Location 2816)

But my favorite model is that willpower is a story. People do what they enjoy, and then narrativize it as self-discipline after the fact. (Location 2819)

the feeling that dopamine imparts is more like anticipation or arousal: “We feel alert, awake, and captivated. We recognize the possibility of feeling good and are willing to work for that feeling.” (Location 2848)

In other words, the voice of dopamine is not “That felt good!” It is “If you do this, then you’ll feel good.” Which (Location 2855)

But curiosity has another quality that makes it a much more sustainable, potentially even addictive, source of motivation: the more gaps you fill, the more you see. The more you know, the more you know you don’t know, the fractal nature of your ignorance unfolding endlessly before you. (Location 2869)

“What exactly is a habit?” It has a physical manifestation, but is defined primarily in the mind. It exists in time and through time, but depends equally on past performance and future intention. (Location 2881)

thinking of a habit not as a “thing,” but as an emergent pattern. An emergent pattern arises from the interactions between simpler parts, but is also distinct from those parts. Think (Location 2889)

success is an emergent pattern of emergent patterns, even more resistant to imitation. (Location 2902)

The upshot is that by accepting that habits, as emergent patterns, cannot be directly programmed to achieve certain goals, we are led to an uncomfortable conclusion: that despite being partially defined in terms of future intentions, habits cannot be designed and executed strictly according to upfront intentions.

“Across dozens of studies on behavior change interventions, researchers have found that the conscious mind’s sincere, concerted intention to change behavior has little relationship to actual change in behavior.” (Location 2907)

Disturbance propagation describes one way that emergent systems can change — by using an external disturbance as the “seed” of a new pattern, and propagating this new pattern across the rest of the system in a cascading sequence. Think (Location 2917)

This study reported that 36% of successful changes in behavior were associated with a move to a new place (nearly three times the rate associated with unsuccessful changes). (Location 2929)

I’m sure you’ve experienced this — moving to a new city or traveling, suddenly all your behavioral axioms become unmoored from their context, and it takes all your energy to fulfill basic needs like food, water, and a place to sleep. It is during these in-between times that new habits are formed and old ones broken almost effortlessly. From the chaos emerges a new pattern of habits to resolve a new set of forces. (Location 2931)

But computer modeling of emergent systems in recent years has led to a firm conclusion, as described in Growing Artificial Societies: “Bottom-up models suggest that certain cataclysmic events — like extinctions — can be brought on endogenously, without external shocks (like meteor impacts) through local interactions alone.” (Location 2945)

Even small failures lead to learned helplessness so quickly, we learn to protect against that eventuality by not trying new things unless success is guaranteed. (Location 2963)

One of the necessary aspects of any experimentation framework is the atomization and disposability of the things being tested. The Scientific Method doesn’t work if hypotheses can’t be discarded. (Location 2971)

What we need if we want to change behavior at this fundamental level is to replace predictive models of behavior change — do this and you’ll get that — with exploratory models. The (Location 2986)

purpose of an exploratory model would be to guide further inquiry, to help formulate relevant questions, and to identify repeating patterns, whether in the form of habits or new, more helpful self-concepts. Just (Location 2987)

Self-forgiveness is the first step in fostering an invitational attitude that is open to feedback, from yourself and others. (Location 2996)

Essentially, because habits are MVBs — Minimum Viable Behaviors. They have a clear beginning, middle, and end (cue, behavior, reward), making them easy to define and identify when they appear. (Location 3027)

They are complex but can be measured as binary: did it/didn’t do it. They (Location 3032)

Lastly, habits are famously difficult to create and sustain; yet every person maintains many habits, and they come and go all the time. This paradox is a strong hint that they flourish only as organic, emergent patterns. (Location 3034)

There is a scientific sensibility — a subjective, yet dispassionate mode of observing and thinking that lies at the heart of true inquiry. (Location 3050)

Self-tracking enhances self-awareness by providing a concrete mechanism for self-reflection: the act of recording. So-called “active tracking” requires the subject to input something manually — a response to a question, a self-reported evaluation, or a device reading. (Location 3071)

the single factor with the highest correlation with unhappiness across the entire study was mind-wandering. (Location 3088)

When it comes to individual self-experimentation, the Hawthorne Effect is turned on its head: who cares if you change your behavior only because you know you’re being watched, when watching yourself continuously is the whole point? (Location 3094)

We are all victims, at some point in our lives and especially in our most unique traits, of the Ecological Fallacy — inferences about us made from inferences about a group to which we belong, which are then turned into individual prescriptions presented as objective facts. (Location 3133)

Discrete experiments give you more attempts by turning the fundamental attribution error to your advantage: containing failure to a particular experiment, while taking general credit for successes. (Location 3188)

mortal. As Lewis Hyde explains in The Gift, imagination has a half-life: “…when possible futures are given and not acted upon, then the imagination recedes. And without the imagination we can do no more than spin the future out of the logic of the present; we will never be led into new life because we can work only from the known.” (Location 3220)

It’s been noted that the best writers know the rules of writing well enough to break them in creative ways. The rules in this way are more than rules. In the beginning, they are crutches. Later, they become guides and useful defaults. Eventually, they become springboards. They crystallize the moments where a writer has to decide what she believes, who she isn’t, and by process of elimination, who she is. (Location 3238)

“The opposite of every great truth is also true.” (Location 3248)

The ultimate purpose of productivity and self-improvement frameworks is thus to help you gain self-knowledge through the medium of practical lessons in getting shit done. At best, they provide tools and maps to help you traverse this uncanny valley, from truth to truth, where conventional wisdom breaks down, but your personal map has yet to take over. (Location 3254)

Meta-skill (n): a skill that allows one to leverage other skills, made up of practical knowledge tied to an internal sense of self-efficacy (Location 3282)

This is perhaps a different way of thinking about productivity — as a portfolio of learnable meta-capabilities that are mixed and matched to produce situational, non-linear performance. Each (Location 3298)

these meta-skills — defining one’s own work, inducing particular states of mind, systems thinking, habit formation, self-quantification, etc. — could be the target of a variety of self-experiments, each one defining and splicing the skill differently depending on the needs of the moment.

Ideally, each step consolidates past lessons and frames the next leg of the journey in the form of a new macro-law — a fundamental axiom about oneself designed to guide the next phase of exploration and learning. (Location 3313)

a “limiting belief.” A constraint that one minute helps you focus, in the next minute blinds you to an opportunity. (Location 3324)

This is why the skill of constantly formulating, discarding, testing, and refining macro-laws may be the most “meta” productivity skill of all. (Location 3326)

The goal is to define the direction of further study by “picking out a range of situations that occur frequently or involve possibilities that lever the system onto new paths.” (Location 3335)

it takes creativity, intuition, and deep self-knowledge to formulate new macro-laws about ourselves that both fit our past and current identity, and simultaneously guide our future in interesting directions. (Location 3343)

The prolonged and intense interaction with the subject matter undertaken in order to experimentally control irrelevant sources of variation probably constituted a rich source of ideas for further experimentation. (Location 3361)

Their purpose is to work themselves out of a job, by helping you internalize the dynamics that generate high performance such that you no longer need external support. (Location 3379)

He argues that there is a problem with how we think about emergent, complex systems (like productivity, consciousness, and life): we imagine each as “more than the sum of its parts.” This has become practically the definition of emergence: life is more than just chemistry; information is more than just bits; consciousness is more than just neurons. (Location 3401)

problem is that trying to define this “something more” sets us up with an impossible metaphysical choice. It forces us to answer the question, “What is added to brains to make them into minds?” If I say “nothing,” I am a reductive materialist, claiming that the very consciousness I use to hold this belief is unreal, an illusion, or an epiphenomenon at most. But if I say “something,” then I am a mystic, and must accept a soul, a spirit, or at the very least, a little homunculus at the controls. Without (Location 3406)

Purpose refers to a future goal that doesn’t yet exist; Function relates to an external mapping that is likewise immaterial; even Information seems to be distinguishable from noise only by its being “about” something else (its intentionality, in philosophical terms). This (Location 3415)

Nothing magical or mysterious is added to the threads to make it a rug, yet you could individually replace each thread and still have the same rug. It is the connectional geometry of the system, the ways that constraints interact at different levels, that produces the emergent rug. (Location 3423)

Like Bénard cells forming into hexagonal columns of moving liquid to more quickly dissipate their heat. This not only eliminates the problematic requirement that evolution be end-directed, but replaces it with another very easy requirement: that energy be constantly added to the system. Life then is merely the most efficient means of dissipating the solar energy bombarding the Earth every day. Humbling. (Location 3432)

work creates constraints (building a dam to channel water), but constraints also create work (a dam using channeled water to produce electricity). Round and round they go, constraints generating work to create more constraints to generate more work. (Location 3439)

What sets us apart is the power of our intention. Our ability to orient our lives, our families, even entire nations, toward vast improbable futures of our own imagining. Our ability to pit the laws of thermodynamics against each other to produce complexity out of randomness. To organize diverse means in service of an end that “pulls” reality toward the vacuum of its immense non-existence. (Location 3446)

The future we intend is like the hole at the center of a wheel — defined by what is not present, yet nonetheless pulling all the molecules and atoms around it in arcs. This central axis constrains the movements of atoms, which constrain molecules, which constrain the wood fibers, all the way up through ascending levels of complexity, until the incredible capacity to roll, unfathomable to any individual atom, emerges at the top. Our (Location 3454)

personal system of truths — our meta-skills and macro-laws — are the spokes of the wheel that we tune for optimal performance. But they can only accelerate the dynamic of “rolling somewhere” that emerges from a central axis — a not-yet-existing but intentioned future. Adding constraints, tightening the spokes around their axis, we spin faster and faster, accelerating our own evolution in its eternal bid to self-simplify. (Location 3457)

Extend your mind book
If you are lucky enough to go beyond this, the bottleneck moves once again: to your assumptions. They constrain your view, what you are allowed to see, and thereby the thoughts and actions available to you. You start getting a kick out of unearthing new assumptions, shining a light on blindspots that, by definition, you didn’t know you didn’t know about. This process is unbounded, because with enough examination, all your beliefs are revealed to be assumptions. (Location 563)

Toward the end of his life, Taiichi Ohno, the creator of the Toyota Production System (TPS) that revolutionized manufacturing around the world, said a curious thing: “I’m proud to be Japanese and I wanted my country to succeed. I believed my system was a way that could help us become a modern industrial nation. That is why I had no problem sharing it with other Japanese companies, even my biggest competitors. But I was very, very concerned that you Americans and Europeans would understand what we were doing, copy it, and defeat us in the marketplace. I did my best to prevent the visitors from fully grasping our overall approach . I explained it by talking about reduction of the seven wastes (muda)…and by talking about techniques with Japanese names like kanban.” (Location 579)
