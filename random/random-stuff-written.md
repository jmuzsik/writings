The meme of the mind as brain
The mind is not complex, the brain is

This is a form of creative writing that I attribute to A Course in Miracles, the Bible, and most spiritual/religious writing. The practice requires the use of authority, rhythm and common sense about very personal subjects. The trick is to not explain, and leave a heavy dose of mystery in the air. I will coin this form of writing to be instinctual sense - as it really is a practice of convoluted wording where the author predominantly follows instinct (and a slight inkling of sense). It's basically food for thought, but if this food was some psychedelic plant given to you by a shaman in a place completely remote to you. The food is strange semantics, the shaman is the instincts of a strange mind, and the place is a topic that you have rarely, if ever, visited.

The brain and the body are one, there is no duality.

The evolution of brain and body have always been in perfect symmetry. One cannot evolutionarily exist without the other. The form of the brain is the same as the form of the body. But while the body manipulates the outside world, the brain manipulates the inside world. The inside and outside world are mutually dependent upon one another. So, there is no inside or outside world. Rather, everything we do is both inside and outside. This is to say that there is no separation, there is no duality.

Our brain and body are one through the nervous system. Every body part is connected to the nervous system through nerves. The spinal cord is the intermediary between the brain and these nerves. This implies that the body and the brain are fully connected. They are one. The brain is the source and the nerves are the bodies connection to the source. So, when we use the body, we use the brain. And vice versa.

The brain also contains nerves. Everything that is done with the body is sent to these nerves. They are connected to certain parts of the brain. Hence, when something is done with the body, something is done to certain parts of the brain. We use our body in a plethora of ways. The fundamental use of our body is movement. What we call senses are solely subjective definitions of a certain movement. Our sense of vision is the movement of our eyes in reaction to the movement of light on objects. Our sense of touch is our response to something outside of us moving with us. The more movements our body has evolutionarily developed to react to, the more of our brain has developed to utilise these movements.

We have developed a way to utilise movements so we can create. The more varied ways in which we can move the world around us, the more various our creations. Creation is the bringing about of more movement. Our body moves in reaction to an attempt at creation and our brain moves to absorb this creation. Our body is what creates, our brain is where the creation lives on. Our body and brain make our being.

The mind is not one with our being, there is a duality.

The being, unlike the mind and the brain - are not one. The mind is a creation that our being has absorbed in response to that which forces us into creating it. The mind is in no way biological, unlike the being which is purely biological. The mind has been created as it has allowed us to be more varied in our movements. Our being has evolutionary developed to accommodate the new movements that come into existence through the mind. The mind never creates, it is separate from us. It is around us at all times, but is never us. We live in its creation but we are not it.

The mind is a background that we perpetually interact with. Everything that we create is an answer to the mind. The mind asks us to create something, and we respond. The mind communicates with us through a subset of itt, the conscience. The conscience is the mind manifesting itself in a way we can comprehend. The conscience continually asks us to test the limits of our movements. All we ever do is respond in the positive or negative.

Our response stems from our willingness to know the conscience. When we are unwilling, we respond in the negative. When we are willing we respond in the positive. To respond in the negative is to respond in a way disconnected from the conscience, and vice versa. To disconnect from the conscience is to question the conscience. But the conscience only communicates through questions of its own. Hence, your questions receive no response. So, to respond in the positive is to respond to that which exists while a response in the negative is to respond to nothing.

You do not exist if you do not answer positively. A positive response is to cultivate your connection to the conscience and become a part of it. A negative response is to alienate and separate your self from it. The conscience only asks you to create something onto the canvas which is the mind. This canvas is separate from time and space. It is a canvas of movement, it is the canvas that describes to all of us what movements are possible. So to answer positively is to create new movements.

The mind is either included or excluded from our being.

Our being is our body and our brain. As was said earlier, our body moves in reaction to an attempt at creation and our brain moves to absorb this creation. In relation to the mind

To say that our conscience is not us is to say that we are also not our will. Our will is a historical process. We have learned to have a will through those who have influenced us.

Water

- Water that falls on the land surface as precipitation is stored within snowpacks, lakes, resevoirs, soils, and underground aquifers.
- The availability affects the type and abundance of vegetation, the primary source of animals and people.
- snow can somehow be brought into the discussion
  - perhaps a different form of information, of physical activity
- A larger portion of Earth's surface is covered by water than by land, however, more precipitation falls onto the land. Since weather patterns form and dissipate slower over the water than over the land, there is more circulation occurring in the atmosphere above the land and, therefore, more cloud formation."
  - One can think of this as when one creates more wind (synonymous with excercise or food), they create more precipitation.
- About 70 percent of the human body is made up of water and, coincidentally, more than 70 percent of Earth is covered in water. Water creates an environment that sustains and nurtures plants, animals and humans, making Earth a perfect match for life in general.
  - This corresponds with the idea that we are very similar to the surface of the earth
- About 75% of the brain is made up of water
- About 71 percent of the Earth's surface is water-covered, and the oceans hold about 96.5 percent of all Earth's water.
- The human brain contains approximately one hundred billion neurons
  - This is about the same as the number of stars in the Milky Way galaxy. These neurons are connected by trillions of connections, or synapses. Experts call this a “neuron forest”. Information runs between these neurons in your brain for everything we see, think, or do. These neurons move information at different speeds. The fastest speed for information to pass between neurons is about 250 mph. That being said, neurons only make up 10% of the brain.
- The human brain gets smaller as we get older
  - Human brain keeps developing until you are in your late 40s. It is the only organ in the human body to undergo development for such a long time. It also sees more changes than any other organ. Around mid-life, the brain will begin to shrink. However, size doesn’t matter in the brain. There is no evidence that a larger brain is smarter than a smaller one.
- Your brain is a random thought generator
  - In 2005, the National Science Foundation published an article regarding research about human thoughts per day. The average person has about 12,000 to 60,000 thoughts per day. Of those, 95% are exactly the same repetitive thoughts as the day before and about 80% are negative.
- Exercise is just as good for your brain as it is for your body
  - Aerobic exercise raises your heart rate and increases blood flow to your brain. As your increased breathing pumps more oxygen into your bloodstream, more oxygen is delivered to your brain. This leads to neurogenesis—or the production of neurons—in certain parts of your brain that control memory and thinking. Neurogenesis increases brain volume, and this cognitive reserve is believed to help buffer against the effects of dementia.
  - It has been noted that exercise promotes the production of neurotrophins, leading to greater brain plasticity, and therefore, better memory and learning. In addition to neurotrophins, exercise also results in an increase in neurotransmitters in the brain, specifically serotonin and norepinephrine, which boost information processing and mood.
- Primary parts of the brain
  - The frontal cortex (located at the very front of the frontal lobe) – plays role in a range of cognitive functions, including attention, decision making, planning complex behaviors, and regulating social actions. This is typically termed executive function.
    - This is literally analogous to the most basic form of thought - where you direct your attention
    - This can be related to the first place that the reservoir lets water into. This is analogous to streams. Think of it this way. Blood and hence water comes from the arteries in our neck to our brain. The frontal lobe is at the most obscure place in the structure of the brain. All other parts are basically vertically above (or close to) the arteries that bring blood to the brain. As the frontal lobe is further in the vertical direction it is where the blood takes longest to reach and recede. The reason for this is because it is where the streams begin. It is connected to the other parts of the brain, and the gates open to the other parts from the frontal lobe. First to the middle, etc.
    - The frontal lobe is the largest lobe of the brain and makes up about a third of the surface area of each hemisphere
  - The middle of the brain (in the parietal lobe, roughly just after the border of the frontal cortex) is involved in both motor processing (the feeling of touch) and in motor coordination (movement) . These aren’t the only brain areas involved in these processes, but they are the principal actors.
    - Now, this is a bit more complicated than simple emotion, this is muscle memory or longer thoughts than immediate short-term thoughts
    - This is
  - The occipital cortex is involved insight – it features many different layers, each of which processes a different component involved in perceiving the world visually.
  - The temporal lobes are largely discussed for their relevance in language – the left side of the brain features Wernicke’s and Broca’s areas, involved in speech comprehension and speech production, respectively (there is a bit more complex than this seems to state, but the general concept holds true).
  - Within the brain, there are several other regions that are of note, including the basal ganglia (a collection of regions involved in action selection), the hippocampi (involved in-memory processing), and the amygdalae (involved in fear processing).

In many species — including all vertebrates — the nervous system is the most complex organ system in the body, with most of the complexity residing in the brain. The human brain alone contains around one hundred billion neurons and one hundred trillion synapses; it consists of thousands of distinguishable substructures, connected to each other in synaptic networks whose intricacies have only begun to be unraveled. At least one out of three of the approximately 20,000 genes belonging to the human genome is expressed mainly in the brain.

- Fact of the complexity and importance of the brain

Due to the high degree of plasticity of the human brain, the structure of its synapses and their resulting functions change throughout life

- Rivers growing, rivers becoming dry

Major geographical parts of the brain

- Frontal lobe
- Central sulcus - also called the central fissure
  - In geology, a fissure is a fracture or crack in rock along which there is a distinct separation; fissures are often filled with mineral-bearing materials.
  - Separates parietal and frontal lobe, specifically the primary motor cortex and the primary somatosensory cortex
  - Previous studies have also shown that the location where the split in the central sulcus occurs is at the division point between the wrist and the individual digits (fingers) in primary motor cortex, further implicating the relation between the development of this region through the use of their digits (fingers).
  - The surface area of the central sulcus has proven to have an effect on the handedness of an individual.[11] Studies have found that when the central sulcus is larger in the left hemisphere, the individual tends to me more right hand dominant. This is also true about the central sulcus for left handed individuals; there is a greater surface area of the central sulcus in the right hemisphere
  - motor representation is orderly arranged (in an inverted fashion) from the toe (at the top of the cerebral hemisphere) to mouth (at the bottom) along the central culcus
- Primary motor cortex
  - Plans and executes movements
  - Left side controls movement of right side of body and vice versa
  - The amount of primary motor cortex devoted to a body part is not proportional to the absolute size of the body surface, but, instead, to the relative density of cutaneous motor receptors on said body part. The density of cutaneous motor receptors on the body part is generally indicative of the necessary degree of precision of movement required at that body part. For this reason, the human hands and face have a much larger representation than the legs.

  - Contains Betz cell's
    - "synapse directly with their target muscles"
  - Other cells exist like Betz cell's that also directly connect to muscles
- Occipital lobe
  - primary visual cortex
    - signal transduction from retina to portray light is from this area
- White matter appears to be at the bottom area of each lobe, check up on that
- "Projection structure"

Structure:

- Streams
  - Stem from the frontal lobe
  - I must find a way to bring about logic that the movement of blood/water from the frontal lobe moves to the other lobes in some way.

The order in the brain is governed by a simple organizational principle: neurons with similar or related functions are grouped together and interconnected. That gets their messages to each other fast and take up little room."

Sperry and his colleagues began with experiments on cats and monkeys that had been trained to perform well-defined cognitive tasks in repsonse to sensory inputs from either the left or the right side of the body. After splitting the animals' brains in half, the cognitive capacity of each half could thus be tested separately. The testing revealed a variety of cognitive deficiences, depending on the task learned, but they all came down to this: what one half of the bain had learned was not passed on to the other.

...the neurons with branced dendrites that recieve both excitatory and inhibitory inputs. The dendrite membrane integrates these inputs, and the result of these computations determines the neurons' firing rate of electrical pulses; the ecvitatory inputs tend to raise the rate and the inhibitory inputs, to lower it. This statistical game decides what information gets through the way station and what does not.

Cells in the gray mantle of our brain do the abstracting, and chief among them are the complex cells. These represent all orientations -- the vertical, horizontal, and every possible oblique. ...the orderliness is unmistakably related to the abstracting function: the cells in any given column code for the same spatial orientation; they are stacked upon each other in the columns, as teh microelectrode probings showed, according to their orientation preferences - the brain version of computer files.

...will the information lines eventually converge onto a pontiff in the cell hierarchy, a neuron that responds to a whole collection of essential attributes of the things we see and recognizes them all at once?

...signals arriving synchronously at the dendritic tree stand a better chance to get through to the next information-processing stage than signals arriving helter-skelter. Temporal coherence of signals, not the running average, here will carry the day.

Prefontal cortex, the part of the brain is most complex and developed in humans, the closest place where our minds sit.

Grey vs white matter? Grey vs white matter tracts?

Areas of deep grey matter (basal forebrain nuclei, claustrum, basal ganglia)

Diencephelon

- Thalamus
  - look like small hard boiled eggs
  - intermediary between sensory input and cortex
    - basically there are sections in the thalamus related to specific body parts that then send to the cortex
    - it's a relay structure that can be modulated
- Hypothalamus - Not a relay center - autonomic, basic functions - emotional responses, body temperature, hunger and thirst, sexual behavious, sleep cycle, hormones
  Brain stem
- in posterior fossa - programmatic, automatic behaviours - midbrain, pons and medulla - all the cranial nerves come from the brain stem - nerves that go to head/face/neck - so control of eye movement/hearing/speaking/shrugging your shoulders all coming from brain stem - also takes in sensory input - direct communication through cranial nerves
  Cerebellum
- 11% of brain mass
- There are about 4x as many neurons in the cerebllum that in the cortex
- Coordinates movement
- Have folia and fissures
- Central part controls head/neck/trunk
- lateral is arms/hands/legs

There are about 90 billion

- an uncountable amount of connections

Patterns of connectivity

- How can the structure and dynamics of the brain, in connection with the body and environment, account for the subjective phenomenological properties of conciousness?

Bayesian Brain

Conciousness

- Level
  - What are the fundamental brain mechanisms that underly our ability to be conscious at all?
  - Are there scientific mechanisms that underly being conscious and not simply being physiologically awake?
- Content
  - What we conciously see is the brains best guess of it's sensory input
  - Normal perception is a fantasy that is constrained by reality
- Self
  - bodily
    - a bit of the world that goes around with you all the time
  - perspectival
    - experience of seeing/experiencing the world from a first person perspective
  - volitional
    - experience of intending to do things/will)
  - narrative
    - continuity of experience/autobiographical memories
  - social
    - the way i experience being me is partly dependent upon how i see you as perceiving me

What's really important are the top-down or inside-out connections that flow from the center of the brain back out.

- large number of connections that are like this
- it's these connections that convey predictions from high levels to lower levels of the brain back out to the sensory surfaces
- this idea is called predictive coding
- Allows us to ask what happens in brains that underlies what you happen to be concious of right now?
  - without the metaphysical conondrum of why you are concious in the first place
- ie. this can be a general theory of how brains do what they do rather than looking at specific regions

What in the world is part of the body and what is not part of the body?

- introception
  - the perception of sensations from inside the body and includes the perception of physical sensations related to internal organ function such as heart beat, respiration, satiety, as well as the autonomic nervous system activity related to emotions
- "Emotional experience was really about the brains perception in it's physiological state" - Unger/James
- Bayesian - Emotional experience is the brains "best guess" of the causes of interoceptive signals

Study - Nummenmaa et al

- Where do various emotions take place can be felt in particular parts of the body
  - Our experiences of emotion appears to be intrinsically embodied

Rubber hand experiment

- Volunteer has hand hidden and fake hand on top and both hands are simultaneously stroked with a paintbrush
  - Just seeing a hand like object/feeling touched in the other hand and seeing a hand being touched (the fake one) is evidence that the brains best guess is that that fake hand is sort of part of your body
    - visual/tactile signals to convince the brain that this object is part of its body

"I predict (myself) therefore I am"

- I am a conscious self because I am a bag of self-fulfilling predictions of my physiological system over time

"free energy principle"

- organisms maintain themselves in states in which they expect to be in, over the long run.

Conscious selfhood emerges because of and not in spite of the fact that we are "beast machines"

Episodic memory

- memory of past events that are relevant to you
  - case studies

Is there any evidence that brains can support discrete separate subsystems in a single brain?

- Best evidence is in split-brain patients
  - "Possible"
- Split-brain twins in this question as well
- Parts of my brain supporting conscious contents that other parts does not know about it
- Difficult to test

War stories

- Jesse's dad
  - There were what is called snake pits in Vietnam (which were dug wholes that the vietcong dug and filled with spikes so you would fall through to your death)
  - So, each troop of men had several dogs that they would send ahead of them in case there were snake pits (in which case the dogs would fall into it to their death)
  - Now, Jesse's dad was always the type to take care of animals, he loved dogs/etc. so he would constantly form relationships with the dogs and simultaneously they would constantly die by falling through these holes, constantly tearing him apart
- My grandfather
  - My mom tells me that there wherever the troops went they would sleep in fox holes (small holes dug in the ground for them to sleep in, one per man)
  - My grandfather would frequently somehow survive each battle and after would return to these fox holes and pick up any trinkets that may be there (a bottle cap, a piece of linen, etc.) of men who died and hold onto them for the entirety of the war as good luck charms

Memory

- Works better if it occurs in context
  - Draw upon prior knowledge and link incoming knowledge with it
- Some folks can remember pi to 67 thousand decimal places
