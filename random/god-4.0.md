Karen Armstrong emphasizes, “…the truths of religion require the disciplined cultivation of a different mode of consciousness.” She goes on to note that “Human beings are so constituted that periodically they seek out ekstasis, a ‘stepping outside’ the norm. Today people who no longer find it in a religious setting resort to other outlets: music, dance, art, sex, drugs, or sport.”[ (Location 314)

From a psychological point of view, “service” directs attention away from the individual, and that again moves consciousness away from the self to experience the unity of the world and, at the same time, to understand one’s place in it. (Location 363)

We don’t experience the world as it is, but as a virtual reality — a small, limited system that has evolved to keep us safe and ensure our survival. This small everyday world is what the prophets and teachers throughout history have advised us “to shun” — to go beyond. (Location 405)

Since then, there has been a long process of what’s called “decentration”: the loss of humanity’s self-assured, special, central position in the world. (Location 447)

It is a change of conscious perception toward a higher organization, seeing things that seem separate as together — a “higher” (if you will) perspective in which happenings that seem disconnected “down low” on ground level are experienced as part of a larger, organized whole. (Location 512)

\*Our “cognitive load,” the mental capacity of managing information, appears to limit our social relationships to about 150 people, a number established by Robin Dunbar and known “Dunbar’s number.” This is by far the largest social network of any animal, and almost three times larger than that of our nearest hominid relative, the chimpanzee.

The contemporary Muskogee shaman Bear Heart describes death and rebirth in this way: “There are many kinds of death. It isn’t necessary to leave the physical body in order to let a part of you die that doesn’t serve you any longer. When you allow that to happen, you can be reborn into a new and better life.”[ (Location 990)

Sociologist Stephen Sanderson claims that “Christ was the most ‘shaman-like’” of all the prophets.[46] He notes some similarities between Jesus and the shamans, among them that shamans go into isolation to undertake intense practice, while Jesus spent those 40 days alone in the wilderness; that shamans enter in the spirit world, while Jesus was one with God; and that like shamans, Jesus was a healer and ascended into the sky after death.

The development of conscious insight is what the great religious and spiritual teachers have always taught. (Location 1398)

the Axial Age, usually considered to have extended from approximately 800 BCE to 200 BCE, was a pivotal time when human beings all over the world began to reflect en masse about the meaning and purpose of life and death. Just before and during that era, human populations became much, much larger, forcing communities and tribes from very different, formerly isolated backgrounds to come into close contact. Differences in customs, beliefs and values became increasingly pronounced; conflict, war, disease and death became more frequent. (Location 1411)

The Kingdom of God that Jesus spoke of was within us, achievable here and now through our own efforts, actions and thoughts. (Location 1480)

“Jesus was born a Jew and died a Jew. As far as can be determined, Jesus was a faithful and righteous Jew, teaching strict adherence to the Torah.” (Location 1483)

Many Jewish scholars have observed that he taught and argued in parables like a Jewish rabbi. They note that it was not unusual for a radical Jew to be crucified by the Romans — it was considered an extremely shameful way to die. In 4 BCE, a reported 2,000 Jews were crucified by the Roman general Varus. Mass crucifixions were frequently held in Judea in the first century CE. (Location 1484)

Jesus lived his entire life within Jewish society, and his concerns were about reforming and updating Jewish thinking. He proclaimed that his mission was to restore the spiritual nature and function of the Jewish faith, which had declined into empty ritual, worldliness and corruption. (Location 1487)

Jesus’ aim was spiritual revitalization — a “new kingdom” in which those who listened and followed could fulfill their potential and destiny. (Location 1492)

He refers to Jesus twice in his 20-volume Antiquities of the Jews, most prominently in a section known as the “Testimonium Flavianum,” which deals with various actions of Pilate: Now there was about this time Jesus, a wise man, if it be lawful to call him a man, for he was a doer of wonderful works, a teacher of such men as receive the truth with pleasure. He drew over to him both many of the Jews, and many of the Gentiles. He was the Christ, and when Pilate, at the suggestion of the principal men among us, had condemned him to the cross, those that loved him at the first did not forsake him; …And the tribe of Christians so named from him are not extinct at this day.[ (Location 1495)

his followers stayed in Jerusalem under the direction of his brother James. They, too, had no thought of starting or being part of a new religion. They wanted to have Jesus and his teachings included in the Jewish faith, as were the teachings of Moses, Isaiah, Hosea, Amos and other prophets. (Location 1502)

Galilee, where Jesus taught, was the home of the Jewish resistance and suffered badly — the Romans killed and pillaged without mercy. According to Josephus, “One could see the whole lake red with blood and covered with corpses, for not a man escaped.”[ (Location 1508)

By the year 65 CE, believers in Jesus and his message already lived in all the major cities of the eastern Roman Empire. Gradually separating themselves from the local Jewish communities, they formed their own separate groups. (Location 1513)

Apart from the practice of baptism, and the celebration of the Eucharist meal that probably took place in people’s homes, they would have adhered to established Jewish customs. It’s likely that they gathered together in small groups — each group initially centered around one of the apostles — to discuss the sayings and teaching of Jesus they could remember. (Location 1516)

Three centuries later, the New Testament Gospels we know today were deemed to contain the only authentic accounts of the life and teaching of Jesus. Suppression of documents outside this approved canon most probably led the early followers of Jesus to bury the more than 50 texts we mentioned earlier that were found in 1945 on a cliff at Nag Hammadi in Upper Egypt. (Location 1522)

Religious historian Elaine Pagels writes that the “living Jesus” of these texts “speaks of illusion and enlightenment, not of sin and repentance, like the Jesus of the New Testament. Instead of coming to save us from sin, he comes as a guide who opens access to spiritual understanding.”[ (Location 1527)

The Gospel of Thomas contains no narrative, in it Jesus performs no physical miracles and fulfils no prophecies; yet it is invaluable for anyone wishing to get an idea of what Jesus taught. Some of the 114 Sayings in this gospel are similar to those included in the Synoptic Gospels but, as set down by Thomas, seem to have a more authentic voice. (Location 1529)

Jesus said, Recognize what is in your sight, and that which is hidden from you will become plain to you. For there is nothing hidden which will not become manifest. (Saying 5) (Location 1539)

It is important to note that, as the Reverend John Shelby Spong has pointed out, very many Gentile converts lacked the Jewish background needed to understand the references or the context of many of the narratives in the New Testament.[14] The gospel stories include influences from traditions that were more familiar to the Jews, and were created and understood to be parables or metaphorical narratives. Over time, these parables and narratives began to be taken literally — leading, many centuries later, to the great problem of literalism in the beliefs of many people today, especially in the U.S. So when, for example, the Gospel of John speaks of resurrection (meaning spiritual ascent), people took it literally, and, as sociologist Stephen K. Sanderson has pointed out, “things became considerably more complicated. If Jesus was God, and God was God, there would appear to be two Gods and thus a regression to a type of polytheism. (Location 1585)

meditation on the Trinity was used to activate the brain’s second system, awakening a more comprehensive perception inaccessible through rational analysis. (Location 1605)

In spite of the Gospels’ titles, their authors were actually anonymous, and they make no claim that they are writing literal eyewitness accounts or building on eyewitness testimony. What we would today view as plagiarism was common practice and perfectly acceptable at the time. The vast majority of people were illiterate, and stories were told, retold, embellished and absorbed into existing stories, with new ones added and subtracted to suit local circumstances, concerns and beliefs. We would thus expect the “Good News,” or Gospels of the life and death of Jesus, to be similarly crafted. Scholars of the texts have pointed out that Matthew’s Jesus resembles Moses, Luke’s Jesus resembles a Greek philosopher, and John’s Jesus embodies the Jewish ideal of Wisdom. (Location 1618)

“Its themes of travel, conflict with supernatural foes, suffering, and secrecy resonate with Homer’s Odyssey and Greek romantic novels. Its focus on the character, identity, and death of a single individual reminds one of ancient biographies. Its dialogues, tragic outcome, and peculiar ending call to mind Greek drama. Some have suggested that the author created a new, mixed genre for narrating the life and death of Jesus.”[ (Location 1625)

While the stories in the Synoptic Gospels are clearly related, only Matthew and Luke tell of the nativity of Jesus — though the two accounts differ considerably from each other. Mark tells nothing at all about the early life of Jesus. As Jesus scholars Marcus Borg and John Dominic Crossan explain, the birth stories are fictions. Each one acts as a “parabolic overture,” a prologue of everything that is going to follow in that gospel. They were created independently and for entirely different audiences. (Location 1628)

Matthew’s gospel was primarily for a Jewish-Christian audience. It echoes the best-known stories of the Hebrew Bible; for example, the story of the birth of Moses, in which Pharaoh orders that all children be killed, yet the infant Moses escapes. (Location 1632)

Matthew’s “good news” is that Jesus is the new Moses, and the real King of the Jews — not Herod, who had been given that title by their Roman oppressors. Matthew is the only gospel to mention the wise men from the East who “saw his [Jesus’] star when it rose.” (Matthew 2:2, [NIV]) Traditionally referred to as the Magi, these wise men would almost certainly have been understood to be Zoroastrian astronomer-priests. (Location 1635)

The Gospel of Luke was written for the Gentiles living in the Greek cities of Asia Minor and in Greece itself, so the text is much more antagonistic toward the Jews. This gospel emphasizes the obligations of the rich to the poor, the outcasts and the marginalized. In this tale, the birth of Jesus is announced to nearby shepherds — a class of people who, Borg and Crossan point out, were ranked even lower than peasants in the social hierarchy.[ (Location 1638)

Paul, who wrote all of his epistles two or three decades before the Gospels of Luke and Matthew were written, never mentions the parents of Jesus, except to say that Jesus was “born of a woman” and “born under the law” (Gal. (Location 1650)

“The Jesus John intends to illustrate,” writes playwright and biblical scholar Tony Morinelli, “is nothing short of a mystical sage whose words and deeds are loaded with philosophical and theological implications. The Gospel of John is a work of metaphysics with Jesus as the enlightened sage.”[ (Location 1663)

Among the scores of religious sects that offered Eternal Hope or present ecstasy to the diverse peoples of the Roman Empire in the middle of the first century, Christianity was not conspicuous. An impartial observer asked which of these cults might someday become the official religion of the Empire, even a world religion, would perhaps have chosen Mithraism. He certainly would not have named the inconspicuous followers of a crucified Jew.[ (Location 1693)

Early Christians were skilled at adapting and absorbing the traditions and practices of their potential converts. Unlike Mithraism, Christianity was inclusive; it appealed to poor people who felt alienated from the mainstream religions, and to women (who were excluded from Mithraism). (Location 1705)

Christians sought and welcomed converts. Anyone could become a Christian and by accepting Christ could enter the Kingdom of God. And there were real advantages: Christians believed that Jesus’ death and resurrection atoned for their sins and ensured their place with God, and that those who did not believe would go to Hell. Christians “knew” that they were right — and naturally tried to get others to believe too, and so be “saved.”[ (Location 1715)

An important, but not often noted, factor was that Christians stressed nursing the sick, feeding the hungry, clothing the homeless and caring for the destitute. Just as they do today, early Christian societies set up orphanages, hospitals, almshouses, hostels and more, on a greater scale than did other religions. Because Christians nursed their sick, especially during major epidemics, their sick were perhaps more likely to survive, and this in itself could have motivated people to convert.[ (Location 1719)

As Ehrman suggests, it’s not that people had to personally experience these miracles, but that the repeated telling of miraculous deeds and happenings convinced outsiders that the Christian church was the best option, and led them to convert. (Location 1728)

Instead, the decision was to regard Jesus, after his death, not as an exceptional man of wisdom, a reformer and restorer of the original meaning of Judaism; in fact, not as a mortal human being at all, but as one who was God Himself. (Location 1738)

Muhammad was a unifier not only of the Arab tribes; but, as he proclaimed again and again, anyone who believed in the One True God could enter into a new community of unity among the Believers[42] and a unity with Him. “[God] has established for you the same religion enjoined on Noah, on Abraham, on Moses, and on Jesus.” (Location 1836)

“striking similarities between the Christian and Qur’anic description of the Apocalypse, the Last Judgment, and the paradise awaiting those who have been saved.” He points out that “these similarities do not contradict the Muslim belief that the Qur’an was divinely revealed, but they do indicate that the Qur’anic vision of the Last Days may have been revealed to the pagan Arabs through a set of symbols and metaphors with which they were already familiar thanks in some part to the wide spread of Christianity in the region [italics ours].”[ (Location 1853)

Jesus appears in some 15 different chapters of the Qur’an, which emphatically declares that he is the Messiah. In the Qur’an, Moses, Jesus, Muhammad and all the other prophets are extraordinarily inspired reformers and lawgivers, but they are all human. None are supernatural, none the “son of God” in a literal sense, let alone God incarnate. (Location 1861)

The pivotal difference between Judaism and Islam is that the Qur’an states that the Jewish people’s long-awaited Messiah has already come and is Jesus of Nazareth. And the pivotal difference between Islam and Christianity is the Nicaean dogma: the doctrine of the Trinity, which holds that God is not one, but three coeternal, consubstantial persons or hypostases — the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit — and that Jesus of Nazareth is that Son. The Qur’an strongly disagrees: People of the Book! Do not go to excess in your religion. Say nothing but the truth about God. The Messiah, Jesus son of Mary, was only the Messenger of God and His Word, which He cast into Mary, and a Spirit from Him. So have faith in God and His Messengers. Do not say, ‘Three.’ It is better that you stop. God is only One God. He is too Glorious to have a son. Everything in the heavens and in the earth belongs to Him. God suffices as a Guardian. The Messiah would never disdain to be a servant to God, nor would the angels near to Him. (Location 1868)

Neither Judaism nor Islam has a doctrine of the Trinity or anything like it; and neither religion accepts the doctrine of original sin or redemption. (Location 1876)

As in the Qur’an, James, as leader of the early Jewish Christian community, strongly emphasizes that the works that one performs in life are the basis of one’s validation in the sight of God: “What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? Can faith save him?” (Location 1886)

Each understood his function included the need to reform, refresh and update his community’s spiritual understanding and the religious practices which had ceased to serve an evolutionary purpose. With this common goal in mind, one could draw a straight line from Abraham, Moses and the other Jewish prophets to Jesus and his brother James and, finally, to Muhammad. Idries Shah has observed: It is this spirit and this claim to the essential unity of divine transmission which is what has been referred to as the ‘secret doctrine.’ Unless this feeling about the Qur’an is conveyed correctly, the inevitable conclusions about the limited clash between church Christianity and formal Islam becomes the only frame of reference (Location 1928)

The habit of confusing opinion with knowledge, a habit which is to be met with every day at the current time, Ghazali regards as an epidemic disease.”[ (Location 2031)

Based on what we now know about the mind’s workings, we can safely say that our everyday experience is not, in fact, “reality.” Rather, our ordinary awareness is a “virtual reality” — a personal construction, something computed within our minds, not a full or accurate registration of what is outside. (Location 2092)

Only a miniscule amount — as little as one-trillionth — of the outside ambient energy that strikes the eye gets passed through to the brain. (Location 2097)

Experiments on frogs first showed that no matter how enormous the variety of visual stimuli presented to the frog, its eyes process only four types of visual activity, each one relevant to its survival needs. Similar, if more sophisticated, versions of this kind of limited processing have been found in cats and monkeys. (Location 2113)

Think of the mind, then, not as reflecting a complete reality, but operating as a device that selects a few parts of the outside reality that are important for our survival and safety, making contact with the world like an elaborate set of cat’s whiskers, physical antennae that touch parts of the world so that the cat can navigate.

Schizophrenia and autism are at extreme ends of a single spectrum[17] and both involve abnormalities in parietal lobe functioning.[18] People with schizophrenia have an inflated or all-encompassing sense of self, while people with autism have a diminished sense of self. (Location 2514)

Daniel Paul Schreber, a schizophrenic man who wrote an account of his own psychosis, believed he “became in a way for God the only human being, or simply the human being around whom everything turns, to whom everything that happens must be related and who, therefore, from his own point of view must also relate all things to himself.”[ (Location 2519)

In Autism and the Edges of the Known World,[23] Olga Bogdashina notes that people with autism very often cannot filter sensory input and are made dizzy by the overload of information. This sensory flooding may lead to self-imposed sensory deprivation as a form of protection. (Location 2535)

After a momentary look at the underlying neuropsychology, it’s surprising to find that some of the most important brain networks involved in social cognition are more activated when we are doing nothing — a time when most of the other neural networks are idle! Termed “the default mode network” (DMN), this is an innate system that operates like a reflex, prompting us to think about ourselves and our social world. (Location 2559)

Think of the DMN as the brain’s “background state” or “resting state,” or the brain’s “idling system,” giving the sense that the brain is just plopping itself down on a hammock after a tough day at the office. It’s important to remember that whenever our brains get a moment off “work,” they go all social to get ready for what comes next in our relations with others. Activation of the DMN stimulates us to “mind-wander,” to self-reflect and think about other people’s thoughts and objectives. (Location 2562)

One study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine the brain networks associated with trance. Fifteen experienced shamanic practitioners listened to rhythmic drumming and either entered a trance state or remained in a non-trance state during eight-minute brain scans. The induction of trance deactivated the DMN and disengaged awareness of the outside world. The authors write: “This network reconfiguration may promote an extended internal train of thought wherein integration and insight can occur.”[ (Location 2588)

During meditation, or while under the influence of psychedelics or during other “selfless”-inducing experiences, the DMN shows a shift away from what neuroscientists call a “small-world” mode, a mode of relatively few connections. This is the mode we’re usually in; the mundane world of school runs, meetings that run late, discussions, accords, utility payments, conflicts with others, and roasts burning. The shift is to what is termed a “random graph” mode in which there are many more possible interconnections. These extra connections can often underlie a more complete, holistic mode of processing and a sense that the “ordinary” world is gone, broken up, and we’ve broken through. (Location 2611)

Think of yourself as nothing and totally forget yourself as you pray. Only remember that you are praying for the Divine Presence.

One study compared the recorded EEGs of non-meditators, with those of Zen masters — while all of the subjects were listening to repetitive clicking sounds. The unpracticed “normals” tuned the clicks out quite quickly, but the Zen masters registered all of the clicks equally. This accords with an aim of Zen: that seeing something for the 500th time should be the same as seeing it for the first time, indexing a state in which one always remains fully conscious.

Meditation is traditionally part of a triad: meditation, concentration and contemplation. Sufis warn that “any one of these indulged in isolation (not as part of a three-fold operation) produces fixity of opinion and illusions of certainty.”[ (Location 2817)

The researchers found that the practice of meditation actually inflated self-perceptions. Participants were asked to evaluate themselves based on statements such as “In comparison to the average participant of this study, I am free from envy.” Study participants had higher self-enhancement and self-centrality in the hour following meditation than they did when they hadn’t meditated in 24 hours. It seems that practicing any skill can breed an inflated sense of self-enhancement. The researchers concluded that “…neither yoga nor meditation fully quiet the ego; to the contrary, they boost self-enhancement.”[ (Location 2819)

Another brain rhythm, theta, with a frequency of 4 to under 8 Hz, has been found to increase only in very experienced meditators. Theta activity in the frontal lobes is associated with attention-demanding tasks, and this brain rhythm is our gateway to learning, memory and intuition. In theta mode, our senses are withdrawn from the external world and focused on signals originating from within. (Location 2853)

Long-term meditators show increased alpha and theta activity even during deep sleep. It has been suggested that this may reflect the development of a transcendental consciousness that persists through waking, dreaming and deep sleep. Philosopher and neuroscientist Francisco Varela has suggested that meditation could produce neurophysiologic changes during sleep that correspond to a progression along a continuum, from being totally unconscious to totally conscious during deep sleep.[ (Location 2856)

Fast-forward to the modern world: Researcher Gregory Paul measured “popular religiosity” for the developed nations and compared it to the elements of the Successful Societies Scale, which includes rates of homicides, infant mortality, sexually transmitted diseases, teenage births and abortions, corruption and income inequality. He found that the most religious societies have the highest rates on all of these! This means that those nations with the highest levels of belief in God and the greatest levels of religious observance are also the ones with the greatest societal dysfunction.[1] Interestingly, the U.S. comes out worse than any other Western developed nation on every indicator, and is also the most religious by a substantial margin. (Location 3010)

\*Religion can take many forms: concrete, abstract, metaphysical, prescriptive, relationship-oriented, inner-motivation-oriented and existential quest-oriented. But, as with many other vague terms, one knows religion when one sees it. In many surveys, religiosity is measured by weekly attendance at religious services and by respondents reporting that religion is important in their daily life. (Location 3018)

Fifty-six percent of Americans, as compared to just 27 percent of Europeans, currently believe in God as He is described in the Bible.[3] Americans are unusually fluid in their thinking, making them creators, inventors and idealists — as well as easier marks for fraud and implausible schemes, ideas, and utopias.

religious conviction buffers against anxiety by providing relief from the experience of uncertainty and error, and in so doing, strengthening convictions and narrowing attention away from inconsistencies.”[ (Location 3114)

A large review of all the relevant surveys conducted in the last 20 years found that a sense of coherence about the world — a concept first proposed by sociologist Aaron Antonovsky, that the world in general is explicable and generally predictable[21] — results in a loss of anxiety and allows people to be happier as well as healthier.

The notice placed above the coffee/tea-making equipment gave the instructions for payment and prices, and included a banner at the top. On alternate weeks, the banner depicted either eyes or flowers, with the specific eyes and flowers also varying weekly. Because of the layout of the lounge, it was unlikely that anyone would notice if someone did or did not feed the honesty box. Yet the eye images had a large effect, with contributions almost three times as high during weeks when eyes were displayed than when flowers were displayed. Which eyes — blue, brown, hazel, round- or almond-shaped — and which flowers proved to be irrelevant.[ (Location 3299)

The evolutionary origins and advantages of recognizing, cooperating with and connecting to one’s kin and kind have even been found in plants that compete for space and nutrients. For instance, a paper on “plant kin recognition” notes that plants allocate fewer of their own roots to gather nutrients when surrounded by other plants of the same kind, than they do when surrounded by “strangers.”[ (Location 3364)

A similar experiment was carried out with rhesus monkeys. They learned to pull on a chain to get food delivered into their cage; then another monkey was put into the next cage, and the wiring was altered so that the second monkey got a shock when the first monkey pulled the chain for its food. The upshot was that the first monkeys desisted from pulling the chain and voluntarily starved themselves for between five and 12 days. They were more likely to do this if they were familiar with the second monkey than if the second monkey was a stranger, and were also more likely to do it if the second monkey was a rhesus rather than a member of another species.

When a bonobo named Kuni saw a starling hit the glass of her enclosure at the Twycross Zoo in Great Britain, she went to comfort it. Picking up the stunned bird, Kuni gently set it on its feet. When it failed to move, she threw it a little, but the bird just fluttered. With the starling in hand, Kuni then climbed to the top of the tallest tree, wrapping her legs around the trunk so that she had both hands free to hold the bird. She carefully unfolded its wings and spread them wide, holding one wing between the fingers of each hand, before sending the bird like a little toy airplane out toward the barrier of her enclosure. But the bird fell short of freedom and landed on the bank of the moat. Kuni climbed down and stood watch over the starling for a long time, protecting it against a curious juvenile. By the end of the day, the recovered bird had flown off safely.” (Location 3402)

Babies prefer to hear the language that is most familiar to them, and by the time children are five years old they tend to prefer a playmate who speaks their own language — which makes sense, since communication is so much easier. There is also a bias not only toward the same language, but also toward the same accent. Race plays no part in young children’s choices: A white child will tend to choose a black child with the same accent over a white child with a different accent. (Location 3449)

Interestingly, young children focus primarily on social comparison, so much so that they routinely choose to get less for themselves from the options offered, to avoid getting more than the other party. However, once children are seven or eight years old, about 80 percent of them will give candy to someone they don’t know; and by age nine or 10 (by which time they have been acculturated, and to some degree, educated), they may deliberately give the other person more than they take for themselves.

So we’re connected deeply to the world by our biology; and this sense of connectedness to others, friend or foe, long predates our species. Morality is not somehow granted from somewhere On High to us “sinners.” Rather, it comes to us from our nervous system and from the nervous systems of our ancestors — as do all the other characteristics of human experience that we’ve discussed. “Risen apes,” if you like, or perhaps “extremely complex and evolved sprouted grasses” — but not “fallen angels,” except in a metaphorical sense.

The contribution of Dawkins’ book is the notion that one’s genes may have different priorities than does our conscious intent. (Location 3791)

“…of the several million chemical reactions in the human body, one estimate suggests that only 250 — a fraction of a percent — are currently targeted by our pharmacopoeia (this number changes every year, of course). The rest of our physiology is still impenetrable — invisible to pharmacology, like dark matter.”[ (Location 3824)

Many studies in psychology and other disciplines have been found to be unrepeatable. One recent investigation attempted to repeat studies published in Science and Nature, both highly prestigious journals: of the 21 studies, only 13 could be repeated with the same results.[ (Location 3837)

A Harris poll conducted as late as 2013[4] found that 57 percent of U.S. adults believed in the virgin birth of Jesus, 72 percent believed in miracles, 68 percent believed in Heaven, 68 percent believed Jesus to be God or the Son of God, and 65 percent believed in the Resurrection. (Location 3894)

It is midnight, at the first moment of December 25th. The temples are lit up. Priests in white robes stand at the altar. There’s incense. The congregation celebrates the birth of their Lord God. His worshippers believed he had come from Heaven to be born as a man in order to redeem men from their sins. He was born of a virgin on this day of December 25th. Shepherds were the first to learn of his birth. At sunrise, the priests would announce: ‘The god is born.’”[6] This story, about a remarkable birth and the ceremony celebrating it, is that of the Sun god Mithras. Recall that at the time Christianity was introduced, Mithraism was a leading religion in ancient Rome. (Location 3910)

Presentism, which involves applying contemporary values, concepts and meaning when attempting to understand the peoples of the past, results in serious misunderstandings. The designation “Son of God” as a title given to people of great accomplishment, was in wide use in the world of two millennia ago — much as we now use the term “star” metaphorically for someone famous. We know “star” is fanciful in such cases, since the lead actor in a film is not a real star that’s high above us in the sky, millions of light-years away. However, one could imagine — going full literal now — the attribution of “star” leading to a cult a few hundred years from now, perhaps centered around a “star” that (like the well-known movie actress Angelina Jolie) had a name like “Beautiful Angel” who helped poor refugees (as she does).

Because it’s so central to Western culture, we’ve mentioned several times how the early story of Jesus’ life changed over the decades of the first century CE and continued to change all the way into the fourth century. Ideas such as the virgin birth and the ascension and eternal life of Jesus, the Savior who died for our sins, were initially intended to be understood metaphorically and to place Jesus in the Jewish tradition (“…and the Lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all” [Isaiah 53:6]). Sadly, it is the literal interpretation of these stories that has become the bedrock of the beliefs of many Christians. (Location 3954)

The good news of the gospel, as John understands it, is not that you — a wretched, miserable, fallen sinner — have been rescued from your fate and saved from your deserved punishment by the invasive power of a supernatural, heroic God who came to your aid. Nowhere does John give credibility to the dreadful, guilt-producing and guilt-filled mantra that ‘Jesus died for my sins.’ There is rather an incredible new insight into the meaning of life. We are not fallen; we are simply incomplete.[ (Location 3963)

When you have that “eureka experience,” it seems to appear out of nowhere. But in fact, the left hemisphere of your brain has actually been working continuously behind your “scenes,” in an intense, moment-to-moment, bit-by-bit mental search for relevant information — until it finally gets stymied and, at that point, goes offline. The brain switches over to its right hemisphere, to explore unpredicted ideas and associations. The specific actions of the brain that come next are surprising. Milliseconds before an epiphany, the activity in the right hemisphere’s posterior (back) area basically shuts down. This is what provides the “bypass” of the barrier between normal thinking and a new understanding. The clouds part in the moment right before the solution hits you. Neuroscientists John Kounios and Mark Beeman use the term “brain blink” to describe this moment when your brain turns off the competing activity, just before the “aha!”[ (Location 4033)

For example, where one falls on the selflessness/selfishness continuum is affected by whether one comes from a Western culture (where the emphasis is on individualism) or an Eastern culture (where the emphasis is on collectivism). One recent study showed that people in Eastern cultures are more likely to use their right hemispheres than are those in the West — confirming something that some people have understood but others have thought to be merely a stereotype.

But “the end of days” or “the last days,” originally meant that, through the work of the prophet or teacher, the present evil age would come to an end. It meant there would be a time when war and hatred would be banished (so, the end of these awful days), and then a time would follow when “the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea” (Location 4300)
