# love is good

- A 75-year longitudinal study by Harvard researchers suggests that love is indeed key to a happy and fulfilling life.
- Love never involves deception, because misleading another person fractures his or her sense of reality.
- Love is not a fantasy bond
  - Too often, we think of love as an almost passive state of being, as opposed to a conscious choice we make... In other words, we come to see ourselves and our partner as a single unit. We then fall into roles rather than appreciating each other as individuals and experiencing the exciting, loving feelings that result.
- It's important to distinguish emotional hunger from real love.
- Love should never be an act of manipulation. It is not a mark of ownership over another person, but the exact opposite—a genuine appreciation of a person as a separate individual.
- To become more loving thus means recognizing ways we self-sabotage: How are we recreating past hurts in our current relationships?
- One of the biggest reasons we shut out love is because we feel unworthy or self-denying. Therefore, to have a loving relationship, we must challenge our negative self-concept or critical inner voice.

Damn kid thinking he knows what love is. Love is settling, that’s really all it is. Fucking settling.
