remember talking about it with Janice one day, we walked in park slope...

We can define rituals as symbolic techniques of making oneself at home in the world. They transform being-in-the-world into a being-at-home. They turn the world into a reliable place. They are to time what a home is to space: they render time habitable. They even make it accessible, like a house. They structure time, furnish it. (Location 139)

Today, time lacks a solid structure. It is not a house but an erratic stream. It disintegrates into a mere sequence of point-like presences; it rushes off. There is nothing to provide time with any hold [Halt]. Time that rushes off is not habitable. (Location 150)

Neoliberalism often makes use of morality for its own ends. Moral values are consumed as marks of distinction. They are credited to the ego-account, appreciating the value of self. They increase our narcissistic self-respect. Through values we relate not to community but to our own egos. (Location 190)

Those who devote themselves to rituals must ignore themselves. Rituals produce a distance from the self, a self-transcendence. They depsychologize and de-internalize those enacting them. (Location 209)

It is no accident that ‘religion’ is derived from relegere: to take note. (Location 224)

In the face of increasing rates of attention deficit disorder, the introduction of ‘ritual studies’ as a school subject has recently been advocated as a means of reviving the exercise of ritual repetition as a cultural technique.7 Repetition stabilizes and deepens attention. (Location 230)

In order to escape routine, to escape emptiness, we consume ever more new things, new stimuli and experiences. (Location 264)

Digital communication channels are filled with echo chambers in which the voices we hear are mainly our own. Likes, friends and followers do not provide us with resonance; they only strengthen the echoes of the self. (Location 277)

In a ritual of mourning, for instance, the mourning is an objective feeling, a collective feeling. It is impersonal. Collective feelings have nothing to do with individual psychology. In a ritual of mourning, the community is the actual subject that mourns. Faced with the experience of loss, the community imposes the mourning upon itself. (Location 284)

Depression, by contrast, is based on an excessive relation to self. Wholly incapable of leaving the self behind, of transcending ourselves and relating to the world, we withdraw into our shells. The world disappears. We circle around ourselves, tortured by feelings of emptiness. (Location 324)

But they are in essence symbolic practices of ‘making at home in the world’. (Location 328)

Within the cult of authenticity, the production of self becomes a permanent activity. Authenticity thus atomizes society. (Location 395)

The compulsion of authenticity leads to narcissistic introspection, a permanent occupation with one’s own psychology. (Location 406)

One hearty laugh together will bring enemies into a closer communion of heart than hours spent on both sides in inward wrestling with the mental demon of uncharitable feeling. To wrestle with a bad feeling only pins our attention on it, and keeps it still fastened in the mind; whereas if we act as if from some better feeling, the old bad feeling soon folds its tent like an Arab and silently steals away. (Location 466)

A ritual of politeness is not an expression of subjective feeling; it is an objective act. It resembles a magical invocation that produces a positive mental state. (Location 471)

Today, narcissistic disorders are on the rise because we are increasingly losing the ability to conduct social interactions outside the boundaries of the self. The narcissistic homo psychologicus is captivated by itself, caught in an intricate inwardness. What results is a poverty in world, with the self simply circling around itself. Thus, homo psychologicus falls into a depression. (Location 477)

The language of forms, of signifiers, is characterized by compression, complexity, equivocation, exaggeration, a high degree of ambiguity that even reaches the level of contradiction. These suggest meaningfulness without immediately being reducible to meaning. All these now disappear, and instead we are confronted with simplified claims and messages that are artificially imposed on the work of art. (Location 502)

The neoliberal imperative of optimization and performance does not allow for any completion. Everything is provisional and incomplete; nothing is final and conclusive. It is not only computer software that is subject to the compulsion of optimization. All areas of life are subordinated to its dictates, even education. Life-long learning does not involve completion.

They are an intense form of life. In the festival, life relates to itself instead of subordinating itself to external purposes. (Location 790)

Today’s popular festivals have become mass events, and masses are not communities. (Location 827)

Rather, he is driven to it because life has become empty, meaningless and unbearable, because he is tired and exhausted, because he can no longer produce, can no longer produce himself. He commits suicide because of a rejection of life. It is not a voluntary death [Freitod], but a forced death, a death out of exhaustion. (Location 1019)

Marx also holds on to the primacy of work. History begins with work: ‘The first historical act of these individuals by which they differ from the animals is not that they think but that they begin to produce the means by which they live.’1 Humans have a history because they work. (Location 1080)

In the haiku, the limitation of language is the object of a concern which is inconceivable to us, for it is not a question of being concise (i.e., shortening the signifier without diminishing the density of the signified) but on the contrary of acting on the very root of meaning, so that this meaning will not melt, run, internalize, become implicit, disconnect, divagate … the haiku is not a rich thought reduced to a brief form, but a brief event which immediately finds its proper form. (Location 1208)

a form of ritual, politeness is without heart and without desire, without wish. It is more art than morality. It exhausts itself in the pure exchange of ritual gestures. Within the topology of Japanese politeness as a ritual form, there is no inside, no heart, that would render the politeness a merely external etiquette. (Location 1274)

Superiority in the topological sense, that is, in the sense of being above the enemy, generates a different mental attitude towards the enemy. The asymmetry in the means of destruction at each party’s disposal leads the superior one to adopt an altogether different estimation of the enemy. The enemy is degraded into the criminal: ‘The superior force considers its superiority in weaponry to be proof of its iusta causa and declares the enemy to be a criminal, because it is no longer possible to realize the concept of iustus hostis.’ (Location 1399)

With drone warfare, we reach the pinnacle of asymmetry. The degradation and transformation of the opponent into a criminal is the precondition of targeted killing, which resembles a kind of policing. Drone warfare completely dispenses with the reciprocity, the reciprocal relationship, that constitutes war as ritual combat. The attacker is wholly invisible. A screen is not an opponent.
