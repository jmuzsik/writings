belief in miracles is still very widespread. According to a 2013 Harris Poll, among the 2,250 adults in the USA who responded, 72 per cent believe in miracles. This poll suggests that belief in miracles is only marginally less common than belief in God (74%), and that it is more common than all other supernatural or paranormal beliefs that are listed: heaven (68%), Jesus is God or the Son of God (68%), angels (68%), the resurrection of Jesus (65%), survival of the soul after death (64%), hell (58%), the Devil (58%), the Virgin Mary (57%), ghosts (42%), creationism (36%), UFOs (36%), astrology (29%), witches (26%), and reincarnation (24%).

The word ‘miracle’ comes from the Latin miraculum, which denotes an object of wonder and amazement. (Location 705)

for an event to qualify as a miracle, an intentional agent must bring it about. (Location 853)

Probabilistically impossible events, however, do not qualify as miracles. This is because probabilistically impossible events are in fact probabilistically possible as well, unless the probability of their taking place is exactly zero. (Location 864)

Most philosophers agree that no one, not even an omnipotent God, can perform logically impossible tasks because they would not be genuine tasks. (Location 882)

What philosophers call nomological impossibility seems to meet this requirement perfectly, and indeed the examples of Jesus’s miracles represent nomological impossibilities. (Location 898)

An event is nomologically impossible if it is impossible given the laws of nature. (Location 899)

A miracle is a violation of the laws of nature that is caused by an intentional agent; and it has religious significance. (Location 938)

Leach claims that belief in the Virgin Birth is compatible with a patriarchal social system where rulers are so much superior to the ruled that class difference turns into caste. In such a society the lords never marry people in the lower classes, but they may take concubines from the lower classes. In these cases, the concubines’ sons would then be elevated to the ranks of the elite. Leach finds this practice comparable to the Virgin Birth where Mary becomes pregnant through the Holy Spirit and gives birth to Jesus who is the Son of God rather an ordinary human. (Location 1358)

In recent years psychologists have conducted experiments concerning human cognition, and their results seem to suggest a new hypothesis that answers the question. According to this hypothesis, belief in miracles is widespread because humans are cognitively and developmentally biased towards forming and transmitting such a belief. (Location 1439)

Throughout history, there are many well-known miracle reports containing good examples of minimally counterintuitive concepts. Jesus’s turning water into wine or resurrecting the dead involves surprise elements that are based on violations of the laws of nature yet do not deviate from expectations in an overly complex manner. It seems that these miracle stories have survived for centuries because they strike a good balance by being counterintuitive enough to attract people’s attention but not so counterintuitive as to confuse them.

The anthropologist Stewart Guthrie argues that religion arises from a human tendency to attribute characteristics of agents to natural objects and events. (Location 1561)

If humans see the shadow of an object in the woods, for example, it is better for their survival to recognize it as a predator. (Location 1563)

Boswell also asked Hume if the thought of annihilation ever gave him any uneasiness. Hume responded, ‘not the least; no more than the thought that [I] had not been’. (Location 1721)

Hume defines a miracle as ‘a transgression of a law of nature by a particular volition of the Deity, or by the interposition of some invisible agent’. (Location 1725)

This means that evidence against miracles (e.g. resurrections) consists of the laws of nature themselves because the laws of nature, by definition, prohibit miracles. The laws of nature provide extremely strong evidence—possibly the strongest evidence we can imagine—against miracles because they are established on the basis of firm and uniform observations of the operation of nature. This evidence is so strong, Hume says, that no evidence for miracles can be strong enough to contradict it. (Location 1870)
