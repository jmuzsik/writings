## REMEMBER some of this stuff:

Problems seeking solutions. This is a very powerful way of thinking about the creative process. Implicit in this point of view is the idea that the answer already exists within the question, that the solution is embedded within the problem. If your job is to find that solution, the first step is to define the problem. 21. (Location 421)

A real writer (or artist or entrepreneur) has something to give. She has lived enough and suffered enough and thought deeply enough about her experience to be able to process it into something that is of value to others, even if only as entertainment. (Location 585)

Why do genres have conventions? Why do the gunfighters have to shoot it out at the end of a Western? Why do the lovers have to break up before they can make up in a Love Story? Why can’t we as storytellers “be creative” and simply violate these conventions? Because each of these (and every other convention in every other genre) is a station in that genre’s version of the hero’s journey. And the human psyche takes in and evaluates every narrative it sees or hears according to how closely that narrative comports to the beats and structure of the hero’s journey. Be groundbreaking, be experimental if you want. But remember, the human psyche is deeply conservative and rigid as a rock. (Location 744)

The scarier the monster, the deeper the jeopardy, and the deeper the jeopardy, the more emotion will be produced in the hearts of the audience. (Location 814)

1. Every work must be about something. It must have a theme. 2) Every work must have a concept, that is, a unique twist or slant or framing device. 3) Every work must start with an Inciting Incident. 4) Every work must be divided into three acts (or seven or eight or nine David Lean sequences). 5) Every character must represent something greater than himself/herself. 6) The protagonist embodies the theme. 7) The antagonist personifies the counter-theme. 8) The protagonist and antagonist clash in the climax around the issue of the theme. 9) The climax resolves the clash between the theme and the counter-theme.

1. Every story must have a concept. It must put a unique and original spin, twist or framing device upon the material. 2) Every story must be about something. It must have a theme. 3) Every story must have a beginning, a middle, and an end. Act One, Act Two, Act Three. 4) Every story must have a hero. 5) Every story must have a villain. 6) Every story must start with an Inciting Incident, embedded within which is the story’s climax. 7) Every story must escalate through Act Two in terms of energy, stakes, complication and significance/meaning as it progresses. 8) Every story must build to a climax centered around a clash between the hero and the villain that pays off everything that came before and that pays it off (Location 1488)

Of all the people you will know in a lifetime, you are the only one you will never leave or lose. To the question of your life, you are the only answer. (Location 1627)

There is an Evil Force that is constantly defeating us as artists and bringing to naught all of our dreams. Let’s name that force, accept it as our enemy, and figure out how to overcome it. (Location 1677)

As artists, what are we believing in? We’re believing in a conception of the universe (or at least of consciousness within that universe) that is not random, not pointless, not devoid of meaning. We’re believing in a mental reality that is active, creative, self-organizing, self-perpetuating, infinitely diverse and yet cohesive, governed by laws that are not beyond the grasp and ken of human understanding. We’re believing that the universe has a gift that it is holding specifically for us and that, if we can learn to make ourselves available to it, it will deliver this gift into our hands. (Location 1753)

If it’s our soul that we’re talking about (rather than just What We Write), then our passage through the varying disciplines of this life, if we’re truly paying attention, is an education in editing out the ego, in stepping away from our fear and self-concern and aspirations for recognition, for material rewards, and for earthly payoffs, until we move into the realm of the gift, where what we offer is for the reader’s good and not our own. Want me to read your shit? Do that and I will. (Location 1807)
