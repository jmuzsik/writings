Sitting in Lisbon hostel
I have no idea what is going on around me. People are yelling at one another, expounding energy that doesn’t make any sense. But what can one do. When they have to be a part of it. They can hide or find comfort in a future that is not longed for. Future pain and stress or future lack of belonging.

If you knew what everyone felt when sitting in airport terminal you would be not man. Man cannot accomplish this. We live our days counting each one. We fly to be able to count more before we pass. When we arrive we have already been there. We eat into the days that could have been. I know not what this means, what this brings, and the shades such ways of living color our being, but i know that there is a great shade we all worship that envelops all that is. And when we aim to become more like this, we will be worshipped.

Sitting in yuppy Lisbon cafe
White walls and joyful music deafen

Hungover
Awake when not yet sure of what your body wants. Think it needs what will make it forget what it experienced. It awaits to see what you do next, but questioning you every step of the way. Breaking out of yesterday requires reinventing yourself today.

Time
Time does not make sense when you do not create it before it is made. Ones history is ones future when the history can be manifested where you are.

I broke out of my past and, now, i don’t know what to do. Someone next to me is the same.

Outside, geometric walls, hilly roads
The quiet is fine, the non-doing is fine. I’ve found myself in a beautiful place.

First decent restaurant i go to
Whole fish, olives, generous glass of red wine, 15 bucks

Fat, stereotypically fat. But when the money can flow then you let it pour. Look at the food, whole fish and potatoes and a salad and a bowl of olives, generous portion of wine and an espresso to end it. A privilege. A stereotypical American. Pompous.

Why is no so so universal?

Directly after the first walk
The madness of putting one’s body to its absolute limit. Absolute exhaustion for nothing but glory. The body pushed down, the mind full of images.

After the wonderful restaurant
What is life without being where those that are capable of loving love. I saw a man sitting in front of me, complete care - completely giving his purest self to those in front of him. Oh, to be aware of what others need and to be willing to be that to the detriment of one’s self. Awareness of what it is that they have in front of them and the peace to become connected to them. Tell me, when was the last time you served those you do not love? When was the last time you understood those you are not yet able to?

Sitting at the hostel waiting to shower in front of a lady
The simplicity of romantic sensibilities. When one finds out that they are unwarranted, one can think of nothing else. We live our day to day in hope of such simple realities coming to fruition. And when a glimmer of hope arrives, we hold onto it,

Sitting outside the hotel listening to a woman speaking Portuguese to a child
Softly spoken words. A curiosity emboldened. Speak softly and I’ll look in wonder. How can one see anything outside of the quietness of their spirit. Curiosity manifests itself from an opening given. What is soft, kind expression but an allowance to be more comforting.

Again in front of the lady
I’m not expecting anything. I’d prefer to be confused about what I’m doing. I’d prefer to not know what it I’m trying to do. What can motivate me to know? What can help me escape my so called non-expectation, and turn it into a prayer that can bring an answer.

Sitting outside nature hostel in zambujeira do mar
Confused by the sounds surrounding me, the world is brought to confusion by the lack of feeling within this environment. Why must we pretend to know what it is that we feel.

In a small deli near the hospital sipping a cafe
What brings one to a place so far from where they called home? What is it that makes the only truth they have known seem wrong for them? What can be known in a world that must learn to know you? We wake from sleep to change the world around us by the dreams around us.

In way too much indecision
Sitting here without a thought as to what is worth doing. The only want is that while waiting something worth doing may pop up. It’s amazing how one night can so rapidly change one’s perception. One day we are content in the reality that we must create on our own, then the next we believe that it may be created by another.

Remembering her impassioned political discourse
If you have a child in America the standard is 0 days off. In America you can get fired any day for any reason. 53 percent of the vote is contained in 36 percent of the electorate, republicans. Taxes do a ton of good, i have seen this firsthand. You have it much better in Europe.

Nazi gold
The nazis took the gold of the Jews and then murdered them. After the war was over, what was to be done with all this gold? There is no one to claim it, let us take it: Switzerland

Sitting in a classy spot sipping cafe in Odex
Working on the life i want to live. Seeing a life that can be lived by moving the right pieces into place. This life i live now is not the life i want in the long run. The life that i want is within reach. But the want is not yet rooted. We move through life full of what is repeated within us, but the repetition constantly alters. The decision can come if i repeat.

Sitting directly outside the alezur castle
Grand objects bring shape into a uniform space. This space becomes the foundation of places that surround it. They are monuments which we place as the foundation of our identity.

Authentic Peruvian restaurant in aljezur
Found myself somewhere i know is good. The locals are here. The men that look to work in professions of extreme physical exertion. The food and wine is going to strengthen me. What a plate. It comes from so close to here, the farm is a few miles away. A connected world, my spirit is strengthened.

Sitting in a cafe in Arrifana sipping a cappuccino
Where are the waves and the comfort? Where is it quite cheap? Are there beautiful women? How is the vista? Oh lord, thank you for bringing me to this place.

Waiting for the sunset in Arrifana
Stunning view to the left, a beautiful cliff and many more stretching to the horizon. An island, just a set of large rocks looking as if giant hikers stacked them one on top of one another. To the right, some homes new and abandoned. Behind me, strange deep house music reverberates. And the sun is setting. Next to a tiny winding footpath up the cliff. And the sea, with the sky - vibrating shades of blue. The sun is setting. The clouds are tinting orange, the sun brightness is expanding. To the left the quiet of the cliffs grow more quiet. It no longer hurts to look at the sun. It exists as a slice of itself between dark clouds. It elongates. Bright colors extending in crooked lines. It looks so flat. It is half of itself, it is receding into the ocean. Sad little lips growing smaller. Goodbye sun. The colors are now intense, so many shades of light mixing with blue and darkness. Swirling shapes. Thick and heavy clouds. The sun is whispering a lullaby to the earth. So softly, so quietly - from further and further away. Goodnight, sleep tight, find comfort in my blanket. Know to not forget me.

Fancy restaurant by the beach in Arrifana
Busy people. Everyone is a foreigner. A quite long wait but the food, it looks good. Have patience. There are no other options. Pica-pau is not literally woodpecker. There is nothing too obscure. Oh those who are happy in front of you and those who are not. Belly satisfied, mind mainly as well. The European way, a cappuccino to end the night at the restaurant. Why do so many people drink coke in Europe? Oh i am pregnant i cannot drink, be prepared for the smirk.

Carrapateira
I’m rich once again. The place i am in is not designated for those that live in this place. If they do, it is a luxury. Here i am, rich. But outside, such peace. So comforting.

Standing j front of a remote beach towards villa do bispo
Unspoiled beauty and contented thoughts. You don’t want to pass by, you want to get stuck here. Wild and dangerous currents but parts to take a dip in. Oh, take my picture and the land says take in my majesty. This is a very cool place, no, it is awesome. Secret, unspoiled beauty.

Sitting and waiting for food at a restaurant in Villa do bispo while Dilette is away
But the food arrived so I’m not waiting. Tell me what you want fishie. Before i eat you. What is it that you want from me? Are you offended that I want to eat you? That you’ve been killed so I can consume you. Fishie why? Is there a better way? What is the food in front of me for, why is it necessary? I’m tired, hungry, in need to consume. And I chose to consume you. You could have chosen something not lifelike. You could have chosen less physical satisfaction for more spiritual satisfaction. Tell me, what is spiritual satisfaction?

Sitting on Arrifana beach
It’s the ocean, so loud. The people, so attractive. The sand, so sticky. It’s the colors, so vibrant. And the cliffs, so breathtaking. Put together, it’s all, so powerful. What is happening here? The sun, so intense. What is it doing to me? Ok beach, you make some kind of sense. Oh, it’s such a raw kind of sense. Nature, human bodies. The bright god screaming at us. And bodies welcoming it. When you are in a place, do you become more like a place?

Sitting in an intimate little tapas place where the only people eating are me and the family that owns it in Lagos
A loving family and family questioning conversation. Simple fare, chicken and rice and the juice from cooking the chicken. The owners speak little English, the likely daughter is of assistance and concern. A peaceful block in the old town, people slowly walking by, occasional cars. How is life? Our life has been here forever, we are always here, but your life is changing. Tell me what is new. The man serves, the woman cooks. The man asks questions, the woman listens. We are in a quiet place, a small space, one that has been here for many years. The life that is being lived has been lived for so many years. A woman comes, instantly back at home. The man questions, the woman tells of her life. A static way of life where the moving world takes solace.

Having a cappuccino outside a chainish cafe playing Jack Johnson where some older tourists are binge drinking
A local expat spot. A spot to do what i want. A place to be my ugliest and rawest self. Just dumb humans sitting around intensely functioning. It is a Friday. I’ll just be this thing that beer turns me into. I’m not looking to make sense, just make the world around me more ugly, so i can forget myself. Forget all that is within me. All the missteps my life has taken. Living my best life. Enjoying my life. Living the life I’ve been told and have told is the best kind of life. Living the dream.

Feeling dead in a quiet street
Feeling like crap at the absolute worst time. COVID rest, please negative. Please tell me that these feverish symptoms come from the injuries and exhaustion from surfing. I’m surrounded by people. A man speaks, explaining and explaining god knows what in Portuguese. I just need a sensory break. The sun beaming onto me. The human energy all around me.

Bus back to Sagres from Lisbon

Eating cheap good food in Sagres
When a place is still within its past. When it holds onto its roots. When it focuses on making a home before a profit. Comfort and health in one place. A kind human serving the food and beautiful music playing in the background.

Sitting in a cool little spot in Lisbon
Hectic but rhythmic music playing, punk. The kinks. Only lively spot on the block, so hidden unless found or if you know of it. The servers are so busy, running around non stop. Trinca, crack in English. Reuben de lingua. Somehowiendupintheonlytablethathasatabrlcloth. A colorful tablecloth, full of fruit. Waiting on some form of fig salad. Not even hungry, just need a moment of not wandering. So i end up here.

Reflecting on lost time
What are you without your health? A shell of your full self. Your mind moves languidly. Your body complains to you constantly. And then you remind yourself of the mistakes that led to this. And you try to self medicate in all the ways that make sense to you. You try to move about in quiet ways. You eat the right food. The right drinks. You drink water. You forget about life before feeling this way. Everything seems ugly. Every feeling exists in a veneer of ugly. Your work seems ugly. The work of others for you appears ugly. What is beautiful is shrouded with ugly.

Waiting on the train after going to a friends and drinking a bit too much
Being a presence. People you know but know only through extremes. Where am i when i am with these people? Questioning. Exploring my desires. Women. Who are you? Are you what will fulfill me? You are touching me. I am so unwilling to touch unless i think you can be here, with me, in the long run. Oh friends, telling me their life so freely. Alcohol. But i smile, i laugh, i express myself. I grow in ways dependent on you or others just like you being here with me. Life during the weekend. Continually craving emotional refuge and accepting what is around you. But its so true, it’s not fully desired, what is desired is inseparable but separate.

On the train late at night
What language are you speaking? Spanish, from Spain, i believe. NYC trains, bars everywhere. Orange. And black, it’s almost Halloween. Goodbye. And the ads are yellow. The walls are grey, steel. Such luxury. The train moves so fast, such movement, such sound - it roars around me. Flashing lights and the car shakes so carefully. The constant sound of anticipation, i am moving through a vortex under the sea. Into Brooklyn from manhattan. And a turn, the wheels screech and cry out. Steel caressing steel. Where am i? Closer. Late nights on the train in nyc on the weekend. All seem awake but asleep, bring me home.

## 11/2

Waiting on food in a busy place
All the energy, it’s so heavy. People are waiting, people are staring. And the people serving are moving. Moving with pressure burning in them. And their mind connects itself to their past, so they move without wasted movement. But the people still wait. And patience. There’s a man seeing people in awkward anticipation arriving, asking for money. But the space. White, metallic, hot, bright.

On serendipity
She just showed up. We’re supposed to hang out tomorrow. But she showed up where neither of us thought one of us would be. And it’s fine. The plan was left unfinished, so we met by happenstance to finish it. But so strange. I mean, she was so close to me so recently, but she feels so far away now. She brings a kind of peace, showing up without volition. A sign, perhaps, that things won’t just wash away.

## 11/3

Lagging on the urge to write
I saw her and didn’t know what to expect. I thought, she’s feeling much more than i am, this is going to be difficult. Then we meet and she expects me to have something to clear to say. But when you prepare something and then think to say it it just feels like a load of trash. Your preparation put this person you are about to talk to into a box. A kind of isolated instance of a human. And then you see them and realize that you were wrong. People are always much more than any box we can put them into. So we meandered, I thought, if we sit and relax, perhaps, the words will come. And the words were simple, obvious, we just can’t act how we acted, we cannot create a romance out of our feelings. But you were looking for more words, a more nuanced meaning, and you perceived my lack of expression corresponded with me deciding that nothing more should happen between us. And you’re calling me immature because you’re used to people coming along with a spiel. But I’ve just grown calm because i feel we have come to the right resolution. Still close friends but no romance. But you are crying. So i have to talk, words of assurance, i want to be in your life, i want us to do things together - just the two of us, i will not leave. And then, let’s sit next to each other rather than across, what have you been writing, and oh, i wrote about our romantic night, you wanna read it. And jerrrryyyy this is so good. And shoulders rub and touch heals and we are happy. And i must be somewhere quite soon so let’s go. We hug, we depart.

My brother committed suicide
I haven’t really told many people this. But I’ve been thinking about it more recently. It’s as if I’ve been repressing it most of my life. So what happened? Well, we were quite close when we were young but when he was a teenager, not so much. There’s a good amount of years between us. He was quite normal, nothing particularly odd about him, afai knew. I remember one day he just left. We had no idea where he went. He even got rid of his phone, but his SIM card got bought by someone else. So when my father called it he found out where the person bought it. He would go to that cafe every day and just sit there, hoping to see my brother. One day, my brother came. And simply went home with my father. Now, my father and mother are separated. And, i really think my father should have let him be. He wanted to not live at home, he wanted to live on his own, something he has never done. At my fathers he watched him so much, barely leaving my brother out of sight. But then my brother left my fathers. Strangely, he came to my mothers house. And, it was like nothing was happening. We just said, hi, how are you, etc. Nothing seemed off. And then i heard nothing about him until he was found dead. He seemed so normal. I don’t know why he did what he did. I think he had a life none of us knew of. I remember looking him up online and finding the username in odd forums, one’s gay in nature. I wonder, if that was it, he could not reconcile with the his own identity.

## 11/5

Waiting at a busy thoroughfare in anticipation of a bit of a journey
A place where energy just cannot help but come to reside. Cars in all directions. Always some waiting to move, others moving, red and green lights. A train stop with multiple trains. People stop here before departing. Young ones, after school. And adults moving quickly here and fro. The young don’t know where else to go but here, you can linger. Where there are a lot of cars, there is so much noise. Oh my mind, can’t help looking at those who pass. Attaching the meanings I’ve developed to my interpretation of them. I’m just waiting though. I’ve been petty today, demanding and i wait in this stressful place for the culmination of that way of being. I wanna get to where I’m going. He’s making me wait… here.

Being in a basement where people are talking about character
That’s your partner, it’s like shitting on your own shoes. You don’t have to do that to build yourself up. If you wanna be a social butterfly, if untouchable wanna put her down, that’s not gonna benefit her. Fuck you, i hope you die in a car accident. It’s almost like you don’t have the confidence to be who you are.

## 11/7

Waiting for the train to church after surfing today
She’s looking for a gentle man. A non-alpha man. We’re speaking to each other about others but unintentionally it’s as if we are speaking about one another. She’s too Christian, i say. But i heard that she actually really likes me. I don’t want to get married then divorce 5 years later, is what i heard. Oh and i need him to be Christian because at the core of what i am is the belief in the resurrection, all that encompasses the belief in such a truth. He should not be so rigid in what he values, she says - or rather - he was rigid about what i am not willing to change about myself. Oh, i feel the same way about becoming Christian. You’re so rigid about something i am not only unwilling, but perpetually confused that such a belief can exist in a reasoning man. Oh, your rigidity layers upon itself. Oh, your confusion layers upon itself. Tell me, where is the peace in beliefs that limit others?

On the train on the way to church
My heart is running in anticipation. People are there. People i know well, people i want to know better, and all the rest. And women. Expectations and the emotions connected to them. I’m here, consistently here. I’m starting to constantly be here, I’m planning to continue doing so. But one says they come for god, for Jesus, for faith, for refuge, comfort. But it’s not there that the emotions push out from, it’s living blood. And we’re crying for fulfillment, for our life expectations to be fulfilled. And the ones on the way, just small steps we wish can make them real.

Remembering what the man who worked on security at google spoke about
At google we do differential targeting, we do not target you individually with ads but rather we put you in a bucket of around 1000 or so people and everyone in this bucket gets the same ads. Facebook, i mean meta is the worst. They, without telling you, share your data with Amazon allowing not only Facebook, i mean meta, but also Amazon to use their data however they choose. You add a photo and they find who else is in the photo to target them with your data. Google wants your privacy so they try to block sites from getting your data but there are subtle ways sites can do it. With a little part of the site, an element, a site can find this information, there are many subtle ways. Oh but i am idealistic, i mean optimistic, that tech companies will not do too much harm with my data. It’s continuing as it’s always broken but it’s also changing and always being fixed. I’m trying to hide what i am afraid of them knowing about me, so i feel all of this so strongly. It’s supposed evil vs supposed good. It’s paranoia and wealth and anger and work and news. It’s bits in the wrong hands. It’s your name, your information in their hands. It’s your life being less of your own. It’s here and will continue necessary to adapt.

## 11/10

On concern
It’s urgent, to know what has happened to you. It’s you going through the pain. Silence, small signs of things not being too horrifying. Amazingly, you’re still doing what was planned before hand. So all must not be so bad. But i still wonder. We still wonder. What is a real friendship but a deep desire to share one’s rawest self with another. I want to feel what is most intense in your life. But what am i doing with that feeling? How am i coloring it, shaping it? Where do i fit into it?

## 11/13

On the fragile
Who are you? You seem to know. Or rather, you say you know. It’s a kind of knowing, saying that you know something. It’s a kind of stagnation, saying you don’t know a thing. Something has broken. Fragile things break. You told me, “it’s so hard to put my damage on display, I’m sorry but there are times i have no choice but to retreat inward.” And i became silent. I say, “i don’t know.” You create, i stagnate. She told me, “you keep saying ‘i dont and know’ but you know, you know you do.” I’m not fragile, unwilling to be broken, I’m unwilling to live, I’m as good as dead. He said, “love is being vulnerable.” And there are times i see the reasons that i never wonder why so many of my relationships reside on the surface, rarely allowing love to reside.

Walking with a friend in Boerem Hill
He said: “But do you think of me as delusional, as unreasonable for holding this belief?” And i said: “The thing is, when i look into my future, 5-10-15 years in the future i cannot see myself believing such a thing. So while i believe, inherently, that you are a quite reasonable and thoughtful man, still, I am confused that you can hold this belief. And I will be. Just as you will be confused that i cannot. And the confusion does exist because we both see a certain degree of ignorance in the other. And i do not see any way around that. But that is not to say there is any sort of negative emotions felt, it’s just the reality.” And he replies: “but even so we will still be friends. 5-10-15 years in the future. Us agreeing on this is not nearly as important as what that means.”

Standing, waiting for duck over rice contemplating feelings
She tells me that she’s expressing what we are both thinking. What we are both feeling, but I’ve decided already to not act on the expression of that feeling. There was passion, excitement, desire but i viewed this in a purely temporary way. I decided it to be so. But you’re acting as if that was not obvious. Why would you think I’d take advantage of this situation? That i would suddenly decide i was allowed to develop feelings for you. To me, it’s insane. It’s dangerous. It will end friendships. It will require me to choose you. I wanted to just be loving, to be kind - but i took it a step too far. Though, we did not take the most drastic step. I can not build expectations because of the feelings that were and can be, can you? It’s a matter of how that love is connected to our shared past. There is love. But if the fullest love was within reason, would we have not seen it by now? Think of the past, of our experiences. One night full of feeling does not recreate what was. What is the reason of the perpetual difficulty of me being able simply be a woman’s friend?

## 11/16

On the train thinking on the last couple days
So movement and comradery or stagnant emotions and drama. The latter please. And Jerry, be more urgent, and what was the point of that, and well done. Drinks after. Skiing and money and West Ham. And being kidnapped by oil companies and forced to sign the paper in the name the natives to give up their land. Also, my cousins, my uncle, my aunts have been shot in protest. What i really want to do is start a carbon credit business but not through ownership of land, but through relationships with native communities, i want them to keep their land but still be connected to the global economy. Pho and introduce me to the ladies and Judaism, he practiced Judaism - indigenous from Ecuador, first of the family to graduate university.

Moody creature, ah, hungover. Oh it’s you two, ideas and speculation first, oh but explain better - you don’t see this and this and this, how can you not? Sour expression, ah, exhausted, ah, hidden thoughts. Christianity. THIS is true and THIS, and and and and, oh so much - you spoke so fast, but sorry, I’m still confused why you think miracles are a possibility in the first place. The birth of Jesus, oh wow, you don’t believe god sent sperm into her belly, a human male did, quite interesting being you believe the other things. I’m praying she becomes Christian says he. Miracles. Oh but people always believe things for social benefit, but are you that good? And Buddhism is selfish, Christianity is selfless. What was that i read the other day? Oh yes, that it frequently happens that those who become deeply focused on reasons to believe one religion become deeply focused on reasons to not believe other religions. Suppose they also have miracles with their own long line of ‘reason’ as well, so you need to decide the reason you decided to start your insane amount of reasoning in the first place. Oh men. What was Jesus like, you think? I asked. He was funny. Funny, what? Well, being so is universally loved. Umm ok then. Oh you’re falling in love, oh you’re kind of in love - you’re married. Not really sure how love can happen so fast, to touch, be touched, to give attention, and to receive attention. Yes that leads to some feelings, but love?

## 11/17

Drunken revelry and eyes
So i didn’t know what to do. You’re upset with my behavior. I’m lost, barely being aware of how I’m perceived. I’m doing what i always do, acting intuitively while surrounded by my ever changing shroud called my personality. Which is first and foremost what is surrounding my present but residing in a bedrock of history. Ah, i barely know what i am. I want to talk about things that have been done, things that have been experienced. But to understand you i need to just listen without judgement. I don’t know why you want me to agree with you, i barely know what to think about these things so important to you. But when i listen, it just washes out of you. Oh, words just flow out of you. They don’t exist in me until the moment hits, my words are assembled on the spot. Transported to the ugly pastime, drink. The emotion flowed out, the words became simple, about acquaintances. Then she came with a few others similar to her. Quite a surprise. My present shroud forced me to consider the possibilities. They’re so young but still quite interesting. May as well test the waters. Then they left except the one, the one taken. And the drinks are getting to the head. The man touches her, i speak to her. Death in the family, personal conversation. Shaping one another’s identity. And just eyes looking at eyes. His eyes are no where particular, it’s just his hands, touching her. Oh, and I’m building up jealousy into a crescendo. Lord help me. It cannot be helped. Staring into the eyes of one being touched so intimately. Then it hits. Time to go. Time to express the built up anguish. This will be an experience, nothing more, you two will leave one another. It will teach you truths you did not know but can know in much less time if you ask. Then pain, annoyance, movement away. Emotions real and raw and heavy. Jealousy. It repeats. Please cease following.

Reminiscing on soccer
It’s just a thing I’ve been doing for a while that others started doing with me quite recently. A group of basically all men I’ve come to know through running with a ball with and boozing. They teach me things, they change me but i know not how, no one asks anyone to be any different than they are, except regarding the dance around the ball. We all just want it to be a better dance. But outside of the dance there is mainly maturity, we are all wonderful as we are, we all have something to give one another. But the dance is more violent and intense than what is normally attributed to this word. A man, quite integral to the whole, injured himself non-trivially. So there is fear, the memory fresh on our minds. And there are people new to the exhibition, not so ready to be told how to better dance. One new and perpetually furious at me because of his attachment to a new woman and the fact that my actions towards her appear to fill his heart with jealousy. And there is i, full of wild energy and sporadic creativity and, and, and i don’t hold onto thoughts but just want them to be useful in the moment. And the ones new to the dance, i want to help improve but my words are too confident, too direct, too insensitive, especially to an angry soul. And so provocations and stfu and why are you taking it so serious. And the breath. And back to the game. And I’m just breathing, holding back my exultant heart, keeping my thoughts at bay. 1, 2, 3… and all i see is the ball, everyone blurs into my vision, i don’t see humans, i see moving shapes to maneuver around. I cannot hold back my smirk. And the ball and i jump in a thoughtless way. Anger. I anger another. And again, provocation - drama - apologies by me - not-forgiven - continued anger - and breathe Jerry. 1, 2, 3… i continue to count. The emotions slowly subside. But I’m not here. I’m sick of being here, been sick of it. Mainly as the one is now always angry at me, his eyes have so much fury, i just need to breathe. I am feeling and thinking similar thoughts as he, i would not be surprised if an outside observer perceives i am acting similarly to him. Oh my heart is full of terror. What are we doing? Why must it always be a competition? How can we find peace? And i go, and they go elsewhere and it’s right - i need to quiet my being, I’ve become so loud.

Mercy mercy me
There’s a place in the city where so many of the objects are so very homey. The music is so very comforting. Those that work there are so very colorful. I came to buy Christmas presents and left having spent over 500 dollars, in a thrift shop. I have no idea how they curate so much character in one place. But in there there is so much worth wanting. And my money gets spent. And a woman just asked me for money, and being how i just gave so much I can’t help but give more, thinking of the privilege i have, being able to spend so lavishly. But it’s mainly presents, only 70 of the 500 is for me, so it feels less selfish. Paintings for my mom and sister. A quaint painting of a windmill, very calming. A Buddhist painting of a kind of ritual, quite fine. A vintage blouse full of flowers for my mom. A Jewish stone art work for god knows who. A i-could-not-resist beautiful jacket that was hand painted which is too small for anyone i am giving a gift to. A not particularly nice jacket (now i have a jacket) and a pair of green corduroys. A foldable, very old chair with a pink seat. Old postcards and some plain fabric. Oh stuff. I thought, perhaps if i buy unique stuff than people will be able to attach some sort of sentiment, if it’s the right type of stuff. That my gifts can be connected to a power beyond my intellect, being that they chose me the one time I visited this lovely shop. In the end, the hope is that my sense of beauty, what resonates with me, will simultaneously be so for the ones i love.

Sitting outside kos cafe
So i got a 20 lb turkey last night. I butchered it, marinaded the butchered pieces. Turned the rest into a broth, tore the remaining meat from the carcass and put it in a container. It’s food for people, for people i know, a labor of love. Outside of the raw physicality, the rest of the people were in their own world. There was texting, mainly with this lady whose words and my own words are purely obscure, poetic. I’m expressing myself through the madness and insensibility within me. My words turn my mind into a prolonged form of this. I’m listening to a podcast but barely hear what is being said. I listen, in the midst of eerie music: ‘I pray you believe what i have said, i reported what i saw and heard but only part of it. For most, i have no words.’ The taint of artistry. ‘There was i trying to reduce him at the end of his blameless, creative, productive life, reducing him to an ethnic shorthand.’ It’s some strange law of physics that the suicide bomber, of course is obliterated, but not the head, and of course, the head, they’d find on the top of a pile, and you know, it’d have a look on its face. Even if you could think back over the last year, during the COVID crisis, we haven’t seen pictures really coming out of hospitals, we haven’t seen funerals, we haven’t seen the dead. Those images, those images don’t make their way through to the public conscience, if you’d like, in a bizarre way, that allows us to somehow trick ourselves into believing that these situations are not as horrific and terrible and distressing as they really are. Combat Gnosticism. If you haven’t done that, then the question is: have you earned the right to write about war? The discharged soldier by Wordsworth. A stately air of mild indifference, neither slow nor eager but unmoved, in all that he said there was a strange half absence. The gap between what they know in their bones and what others can know is too wide to be bridged.

Thinking back on the gathering last night sitting outside kos cafe
I don’t know what it was about yesterday but i awoke so very dejected. There was so much revelry, so much gossip, so much drama, so much giving. I barely feel as if i received anything. Perhaps my mind has simply been ravaged of all its energy. It was a party, it was an exhausting endeavor. I laid in my bed for hours later than I’d like because all the noises, realities that occurred, perhaps, had to be absorbed. My mind is full of new sensations to make peace with. The fire was good. Our minds may have become full of fury. A tribal experience to bring out our most deeply held realities. How can i barely feel the beautiful presence right next to me? But the one ahead of me or behind me, it haunts me. The one man lives in a predictable and strong shell. The other lives like a beating heart. Another lives with such kindness and clear eyes. And another is still learning how to organize his own thoughts. A woman I’ve known forever, she expresses herself openly and curiously. Another who lives in a lingering artistic sensibility. One that is hanging on a fishing line. One who is always studying and observing. A woman not simple, she has a conscience, an early history i cannot understand, a loving heart. And the girl, she’s in so many places all at once. And i, just a couple thoughts on repeat, is everything in its right place, who is she or she to me?

They did exactly what humans wanted them to do, so there was no need to select any particular character or trait of these cats.

Jan Morris
I’ve always tried to lace that, interweave it with my own feelings which… may not be true factually, but true in the imagination if not in the fact. Scholarship and the authenticity of the moment and, of course, the latter, has to be expressed in an individual voice. How does personal subjectivity stand up against vast complexity? Nuanced yes, and also with a tendency to mythologize - to make things not merely rose-tinted but a sumptuous scarlet with the writer in the center of the story which rises around her like a heavenly pavilion. It was there or perhaps four years old when i realized that I’ve been born into the wrong body and should really be a girl, i remember the moment well and it is the earliest memory of my life. I was sitting beneath my mothers piano and the music was falling around me like cataracts, enclosing me as in a cave. What triggered so bizarre a thought I’d long forgotten but the conviction was unfaltering from the start. The individual are self-defining, a unity made of personal affinities. I like to feel that in this, as in many other things in life, i like to feel that i am bridging a gulf rather than standing in the middle of it. There is no final word on any place, any time, or any person. There are only the stories we tell. She aims to bridge the gulfs which separate ourselves from our selves and from each other, to touch us behind the masks we wear, to honor the myths that sustain us, this is the purpose of a travelers tale, whether or not it is quite true.

After buying lots of wine
It’s so easy to look at your face. I just want to be at peace, but i have never really learned what that means. So true, that’s facts, this lady’d say. No secrets. Silly faces, mad experiences, impress the lady my mind says. She told me that things are one day going to make sense, rather, that’s what i tell her but i don’t believe it. I’m always saying things like that, this will pass, your mind can be controlled, everything is perfect just the way it is. He goes on about his deep desire to learn about life; to express ideas and build upon them, they can be dug up when they need be, a kind of food for one’s future. Ones ideas develop, you and i don’t know what use they have now but one day they will fruit, you see? I grow silent, i have such a hard time entering any sort of mechanical world without wondering, what levers can be pulled from within them? This is the friendliest we’ve been with one another in a long while, animosity appears to have dissipated. Taking to them both i feel like I’m in the midst of a movie. She, i can see so much slow, heart to heart words with in the future. He, it’s a different form of communication, heady and mainly i see myself listening, and expressing thoughts I’ve never yet had. With her, rather it’s as if i have already had these thoughts, as has she, and we are refining what it is we already believe. I wouldn’t call it two heads of a coin. Such different ways of being. I just want to be able to look at them or even to look around with them and feel as if it’s something that can be held.

Bottom up thinking from Wikipedia
A bottom-up approach is the piecing together of systems to give rise to more complex systems, thus making the original systems sub-systems of the emergent system. Bottom-up processing is a type of information processing based on incoming data from the environment to form a perception. From a cognitive psychology perspective, information enters the eyes in one direction (sensory input, or the "bottom"), and is then turned into an image by the brain that can be interpreted and recognized as a perception (output that is "built up" from processing to final cognition). In a bottom-up approach the individual base elements of the system are first specified in great detail. These elements are then linked together to form larger subsystems, which then in turn are linked, sometimes in many levels, until a complete top-level system is formed. This strategy often resembles a "seed" model, by which the beginnings are small but eventually grow in complexity and completeness. However, "organic strategies" may result in a tangle of elements and subsystems, developed in isolation and subject to local optimization as opposed to meeting a global purpose.

Notes
If an irrelevant object comes into our attention, there is time needed for us to respond and filter out that stimuli prior to returning to what we were focusing on. Many studies show that we rapidly detect angry or threatening faces and disengage from them slower than with happy faces. A driving simulation, the road signs were in yellow, at an intersection a motorcycle suddenly showed up and the testers had to stop themselves from hitting it. When the motorcycle was yellow people reacted much more quickly than when it was not. This is top down attention, a learned behavior, being alert for objects of the color yellow, integrated into our spatial memory, and useful in similar circumstances such as another object of the same color. Correspondingly, addicts of a drug are more prone to advertising related to their drug, such as warnings on cigarettes, which have been shown to be much more memorable for addicts than new smokers.

On the way back from the bronx
He told me: she told me that something was up with our friend. It was 12 AM. Our friend went manic, wandering the streets. She had the intel, being that she was getting photos from the one troubled. A picture of a stop sign, i think, there’s a million of those around here, how the hell am i gonna find her? I’m on my bike looking nonetheless. She’s screaming in the streets, she cannot have gotten too far, find the spectacle. I found her, climbing a 20 foot high fence. Get the fuck down, i groaned until she came down. We’re walking back, and twice she literally is taking off her clothe, in the street, stop this fucking shit. We get back to her place. She has a million fucking keys, and shes screaming at the top of her lungs, the neighbors are outside, shut her the fuck up, we’re trying to sleep. It’s 3 in the morning. I find the key, thank god. And now we’re inside, and shes still screaming, she’s attacking me, i know not what to do, i can’t just leave her like this. I call for an ambulance. The cops come, the ambulance comes. They handcuff her, they restrain her. I didn’t think they would do all of this. They took her to the hospital. She was there for a month, they sometimes chained her from the neck. And much more I have not heard. And the friend says she remembers finding being chained so funny. It had a tag that said two words that night, sober and manic. And now, she’s on so much drugs and AA, her senses are dulled as can be but she’s still there, she has a job, she’s getting closer day by day to being who she once was.

I saw my best friend burn alive
We thought it was an abandoned oil silo. We were drunk and high. I had to take a piss but he and my other friend did exactly what i would have done. They ran right to the top of it. My best friend was smoking a cigarette. They opened the vat and peered down. Next thing i know there was a raging fire. I look up, and see my best friend running down lit on fire. We’d been best friends since the 5th grade. I’d always be calling his mom to see if i can sleep over. His name was Zach. He was the bartender in the only bar in the small town we grew up in. The type of guy that could have a conversation with anyone, he liked slipknot, a smallish guy, always ready to get rowdy. He got down from the silo. We tried everything, stop drop and roll, poured beer on him, towels, it just would not go out. He was white but his skin turned black, his eyes became green, the white left them. We heard the ambulance coming, he said, man get the weed out of the trunk. It wasn’t the ambulance, was a man in a pickup truck coming to help. We put him on the truck. But he was gone, but before he left we told each other - i love you. And it could have been me, so easily could have been me, but i had to pee, i had to pee.

Hit by a car in Soho
I was disfigured on the sidewalk. Just strolling on down but then a truck hit another truck that then flew into me and there i was, a mess of a body on the sidewalk. Shattered ribs, wrecked limbs, blood all over, there i was, on the sidewalk in one of the busiest places in nyc. Next thing i know I’m in the hospital. They are not sedating me but sticking all sorts of things right into me. I’m a bloody mess, and they put me right into a cat scan, and I’m in terror and incredible pain but still they push me into this tight hellhole. I thought it was the end of my life. Eventually it’s another day and I’m on such a dose of morphine. My friends are there. And they see me, a broken mess on the bed. Full of bandages, face beat up like a rag. And I’m awake, and the next thing you know I’m vomiting all over myself. And I’m watching them while this happens. I can’t move, I’m an invalid, vomiting all over myself. And they are swooning. Running around in shock. Get the doctor, get the doctor. What is this hellhole. Omg omg. He’s possessed, he’s a demon, ahhhh. And there i am a mess, hopped up on drugs, laughing inside about this situation I’ve found myself in.

Life happens to us, not for us

There’s a park slope tradition of just putting stuff on the sidewalk for people that walk by

I don’t know why people put out appliances but do not label if they actually work. I’d have to haul the thing to my house, check if it works. Which is just not worth the risk

On the way to breakup sort of thing
There’s one of two options here. Either we go fully in and tell everyone or we break it off now. My intention is the latter. It’s too soon, you just broke up with your boyfriend of almost 2 years. Your not thinking clearly, we’re not acting clearly, this is too much feeling too fast. I’d like to still see you, here and there, but not put ourselves in the same positions that we have been putting ourselves. I’d be willing to consider it perhaps 6 months or a year in the future but not now. Why? Perhaps i think in a quite binary way. It’s not a decision that brings me comfort. It does bring me peace. But why? Because I can’t see myself being committed to you. God i still want to be all over you. But in a way i can move on from. I don’t want you to be the one. I cannot make the same foolish decisions I’ve made in the past. It’s too close to home, you’re too close to home. I don’t know what I’d think if you didn’t date him for so long, but you did, you’ve been right in front of my eyes being touched by him for so long. And you wanted him, you still want him. You need to put together your conflicted emotions before or this can happen. And that will take so much time. This is a faithless endeavor, peaks and valleys but no waypoint.

An ultimatum
i first saw him that day up the stairs in that multi-floor, un-partitioned space. Like a spy, watching from above. And a smile, a wave, he came on down. Normal interaction, just working, the three of us, she across from us. Near the end of the day, existence, let’s talk about existence. Me and she, and he’s listening from afar. And two muse-like woman presumably listening from behind. And, we’re on the fundamental topic, we live, we die, and before and after that, we know not what to think. And i like to take the opportunistic perspective. The before and after is not much different from the current. If you take all that is currently you, this instantaneous moment of you - all the milieu of emotion, of sensory sensation, of mental creation, all that makes you and all that surrounds you - and you ask yourself, what is this? Perhaps you sense wonder, awe, the enigmatic nature of creation. Now, tell me, is that much more different than what you sense when you think of what you were before you and what you will be after you? But then he talks and she talks and oh, the preciousness of being human, and i can listen but i don’t really see how this gets to the root of things. Oh, let me give an analogy to fish, and all I’m thinking while you’re talking is, what a small part of the entire question have you chosen. Either way, i say, we will ask ourselves this question our entire lives, we are just gradually refining it. And then i am reminded, his words, her words, my words all play different roles, they have their purpose. And then we decide to play some games. Foosball and I’m annoyed because he plays too human, too forceful, too aggressive, too lacking in art. And i say what i think, so he begins to boil. Ping pong, and it’s shown the lady has art, she beats us all, every single game. We walk towards his house. Through the park. We talk of meandering things, what should we do, expensive mushrooms, sights and sounds. And i sense he’s upset so move quite out of sync with him. And him and her are whispering to one another. She says, look him in the eyes Jerry, but i just laugh and say something mindless. There’s a self defense class right by us, a ship martyr’s monument watching over us. And I’ve just begun to breathe, i have no words, i sense a mind in preparation. We went to Trader Joe’s to get food to eat at his place. He leaves me, to buy and choose the food that we will eat at his home and when i try to get him to think with me, only muttered responses - a mind in preparation. Food bagged and we walk back, and there is a mood. Oh, i haven’t been here for over almost a year, which is odd, seeing how often I’ve been here, and i say: well you haven’t invited me. And the food is being cooked. We’re chatting about not much. And the food is ready. Seated at the table, eating. You know why I’ve been upset with you, he asked? Not entirely sure. Now i have to listen. I feel you’re intentionally drifting away from me, like you no longer want to be my friend. Like you don’t care about me, you don’t think about me. As if you are inviting me to things as a formality rather than you actually wanting me to be there. I think we should either end this friendship or you have to change your behavior towards me. And now i have to talk. What can be said, i think. I mutter idk what to say, that was a lot, he said sooo much more. More than anything, I’m hurt and annoyed. How people can create such castles in the sky i cannot imagine. But i need to say something. And i think of the past, i know I’ve been behaving differently, things haven’t been right between us. I’ve thought, this is because of the woman, ever since she came we’ve been butting hears, vying for attention - she knows so well how to give attention, how to be something so meaningful to one. And i always thought, this is the reason, but he does not see this. Perhaps, i don’t see how tribal it has made my own behavior. I’ve seen myself thinking of ways that i am better than him for her, for a possible woman. I’ve found myself wondering of the possibility of being with her someday. I see that I’ve been in the wrong, i see that things have took a turn between us. But we’ve agreed, he, with so much detail, has pointed out that this is not the reason for of our perpetual feud. So this thought is not the thought to be expressed. I say things like, I’ve been acting this way because i have been so much more social, so much of my life has been changing, before it was often just me, you, and the woman that has been telling me all sorts of words i have never heard about him. But now there are so many new lives i have to adapt to, and I can only handle so much social interaction.

the pain of forgetting one’s expectations
I’m so lacking in joy. I’m intentionally dead inside, against doing anything. As a kind of revolt against being lied to, a sinking into self pity, a deep awareness of how alone i really am. The feeling: a heavy heart, an inability to act, a sinking into myself. I am in pain, intentionally in pain. Thoughts of separating myself from others, thoughts stating that these people are less to me than they were before. An intent to act less for them, to think less of them. And an awareness that this emotion comes in cycles. It’s truly a letting go. I’ve been acting towards her in ways that develop expectations in my self and i see i was wrong to do so. I will treat her as i used to treat her. He, I’ll be ok with him. I’ll try and focus more on him, not on her. Pray for him, for things to go right with him and her. But she is so much wiser than him, when she is not being influenced by him. But i wont let myself develop feelings for her. I won’t continue to be so close to her.

One night
I download tinder, make a profile and within 10 minutes, a match. She says hi first. I respond. It is 11 on a Saturday night. I hadn’t been on this app for almost a year. How’s your night going? What are you doing? Engrossed in these dating apps, i say. I downloaded hinge a couple hours back but that was slower, less immediate. And the alcohol, it’s made me confident, looking for immediacy. I am listening to Hole i said, i sent the song Doll Parts. I obviously love Hole, says she. And more talk, and I’m in a mood she says, a mood? - i say, you know what i mean, where are you located, Clinton hill, me - Gowanus, in between? - i say, come to Clinton hill - a bar i like - it’s my kind of bar - without personality, ok be there in 30 - i say. And finish the coffee cup of mezcal, think a tiny bit about how i look, grab condoms. I’m on a bike and there barely past 30. Waiting for 10 and she arrives. And she’s waving at me, karate kid wiping the windows waving, I’m doing right angle waves because i cannot be out weirded and then we are playing hand games like little girls in elementary school do. I had the sense you’d be game for this, she says. Into the bar, my most immediately obvious characteristic becomes the subject of conversation - i speak in an accent that sounds very European, she thought French, even though my ancestors have been in America for over 5 generations on all sides. She states, that’s so cool. I get a beer, she gets a water. She pays. We’re seated in the back, she’s asking me for my entire life’s story. Adolescence, elementary school days, teenage days, 20’s, now. And I’ve been asking her in between. She grew up in DC, went to school and graduated, lived in the south for a number of years after school working - had relationships with farmers, she came to the city 7 years ago - working on her own company which now has 20 or so employees. And when she goes to the bathroom she caresses my arm. She gets a beer and i have a second. Halfway through the beer, you want to go back to my place, she says - a breath, ok in a moment let’s go. We walk less than a block to her place. A very modern spot, spacious, good furniture. We sit with a digestif. And we are sitting, talking casually. And what stuff do you like to do? She mentions writing. We share our writing. She says mine is really good, with a few suggestions. She goes through my photos from Portugal, sending herself an image of a white stone which was naturally shaped into a heart from my number. And we can talk more but I’ve been moving closer to her and she goes, i want to kiss you, and shes a great kisser. Lips on lips, talking through touch, exploring new forms and movements, new places and ideas. Let’s go to my room, you don’t have to if you don’t want to, but i want to - it’s been so long. We go. And she doesn’t turn the lights on. More kissing. More rubbing. Clothe off. Condom on. She’s on top. She’s on her back. She’s on her stomach. And I’m done 20 minutes later. And we are talking and I’m not sure if i want to stay the night. A massage for her. More kissing. Repeat of sex. Will you be annoyed if i go home? A little she says. I stay. It’s almost 5 am. A bit restless sleep but i do sleep and the whole night we are cuddling naked. And the morning and her room is visible. Little interesting knickknacks here and there, books. Conversation, her favorite author is Allan Gurganus. And we repeat in the light, surrounded by the haze of little sleep and the memories of last night. And that surrounds the words we say before and after. It’s almost 10 am. We meet at the door. Nice jacket. All earthy colors is this days fashion. And we hug. Her roommate passes by, hello she says. Hello and goodbye i say. And then i say bye to her and she says, see you soon, see you soon i say back.

Being full of assumptions
Where is the peace? Where do i place my expectations? When one thinks they know a truth but hide away from explaining it, does that make it any less true? Do they find out any less in life? Or do they just avoid the experience of living this truth, and all that it forces us to confront? Does this make truth a sort of desolate wonder? As the truth only exists in our mind and we do not experience what happens if we make this the truth in the world. Where is the peace in this? Must we place expectations on a truth? Must we explain our truth, is it truth if we do not? For the world cannot know that which we not explain to it. So how can i find peace? I must place my expectations in truths that i cannot forget.

Monk
A sticker on a laptop. City monks. And a monk next to me then across me. Concentrated on this, concentrated on that. A bike ride. She rides steady, sometimes silly, always straight, a monk. And we are talking, oh those conversations I’ve always had with him, i know not if there is a solution, all i know is that I’ve mainly stopped doing it, but he’s the one touching her and she wonders, can i ever truly connect with this man? And we arrive. That funny run. Old lady Asian run, arms flapping mechanically and exuberantly with a steady body and face. A monk run. Lincoln center, that promenade, that fountain, the opera house framed behind watching over it all with regality. We go to the theater, we sit. The movie that was mainly a beautiful intelligent face. And she next to me, arms folded, looking like a monk from the Middle Ages. Arms clasped with one another, hands touching. Dark form fitting hat on. Skirt and shirt with the aesthetic of a robe. Body straight. A monk sitting next to me. And we go. Thoughts, she says. Oh, i have a bit of trouble sympathizing with fame and the rich, but overall good. And back at Lincoln center. And the moon is bright, looks like a bright lens i say. And next weeks movie, seems like a romance between an older man and a young girl. Reminds me of tbis older woman i knew, she wanted me to water her plants when she was away, and i looked a bit around - out of curiosity - and on her bed I saw a book obviously meant to be seen called: a much younger lover. A bit more walking and talking and we depart without even a touch.

The next day
I’d been thinking that it’s nice, our behavior with one another. Comforting. It’s what I’ve been looking for in another though it’s not yet time to act on it. I’m not so sure if there will ever be a time, all i know is that i want us to talk about it and make it into something that makes sense to the both of us. I did not say that, but it’s my intention. So we sat and finished work early, it’s just too distracting, being alone with you - the words flow out so easily, so patiently. So we go, let’s walk to where you need to go. I know the way. We can take the church way, i say. And the repeated subject, you hear of me through hearsay, you think of what was stated and try to connect it to the few words you’ve heard me say about myself. Tell me of your relationships, says she. Well the last was Sonica but i never really considered it something serious, it lasted almost a year and a half though. It was the same situation I’ve told you before, i tend to get into relationships with ones that i cannot see a future with - and i tell them that right away - but feelings develop nonetheless, much more so by them. And if i like one in a way that i can see a future with she does not like me. And then, next topic and we are passing by this bar that reminds her of LA. She says, i think you are very sensitive, i think this is because life has been hard on you, it’s made you bitter, it’s made you cold. Perhaps, i think, but i again say what i always say, i don’t know where my personality traits have come from but when i look back at myself back when i was little i see someone very similar to who i am now, i see a boy always looking at things, always wandering to the odd places in a place and just looking at them and thinking about them, i see a little prankster, a quiet boy with a quick temper. And I’ve always felt that i take up a lot of space and this is not so much with my spoken words but my presence. Not powerful in a worldly way but in a spiritual way. She says, i can kind of see that. No judgement, just empathy. And we keep walking. And who was the man you saw during COVID, i ask? Andrew, she says. Tell me of Andrew. Very smart, academic, he always could talk and make sense of things, very good at explaining things, was good looking as well. Did i tell you about my existential crisis? No you did not, i say. Well, it was when i was seeing him, sort of. During COVID it was the last semester of college for me. I was living alone in LA, barely leaving my home. I was reading a lot about consciousness and religion and just trying to figure out what it all means. I was mainly alone all of the time, barely leaving home, I’d go to a park nearby, go food shopping but mainly it was just me, by myself and in rare instances I’d see andrew. You were really stuck in your own head huh? Ya i was. I was just building up this world view for months and months and one day i sent andrew a series of texts summing up all of my thoughts. I knew it was mad but it’s just, i had no one else to tell. I hoped he would relate. Things like all is one, everything is connected. And no response, he probably thought i was insane. The next thing i know I’m looking at myself in the mirror and i felt like jelly, I felt like my arms could just be pulled off. My fingers, it was as if the tips had electricity running through them, i could literally see burn marks on them. I had no idea what to do, so I went to the hospital. And there was a homeless guy there and he’d talk and i felt as if andrew was talking through him, he would say things that andrew would say. I felt as if everything around me was living vicariously through him, he was everywhere. I think, it’s as if you built this world view through inward conversations with an idealized version of him and when you saw that this version was not the real him you shattered. And then you speak of the nurses asking you what your religion was. And in your mind it is judgement day, and the answer you give will dictate your afterlife. You say you were traumatized and could not answer, you called your mother. The feeling subsided. And you now view it as a lesson, you have written 7 lessons that you hold dear. You have not deleted what you texted him, you live with your most terrible of memories close at hand. We keep walking and talking and joking. We sit, we eat, we tell each other how good we are at listening. You mention, I’m gonna see the guy you’re seeing after this. You become silly, jumpy, mad and I’m still feeling patient and serene, slowly opening up to my own childishness. Then you go to get something from someone and i am waiting on the corner. And i see a book, some form of erotic poetry just sitting there. And i think this is serendipitous, i am holding a bag with her stuff, i slide it in. And then she is back and we are walking. My childishness is partially back, but it’s a heady sort. She says, someone told me they like my eyes. I think, my favorite thing to say is i like her 17th to the right right eyebrow, rather, i like the part of the brain 2 inches to the right of the ear, 3 inches from the top of the skull, the astralis topolopolo, the part of the brain used to make snowmen. And then we are talking about sex for some reason. I am very good at getting the astralis topolopolo activated, i say, she’s just thinking all the time about making snow men while we’re at it, and then, when she looks down - all she sees is white. We are at the train, our strange departing ritual - pointer and middle finger touching and she makes a sound you’d expect to hear from angels in heaven while you are rising up to god, i walk into the park - she says call the owls, hoo hoo i go, into the park i go.

What if the physical appearance we are born into, is it the foundation of how we behave with the world. What if everyone that sees us puts us into a spiritual role in which we are forever stuck within.

Mind numb
It’s just numb, that’s the main sensation. Just medicine and numbness. Booze and marijuana and trees and fresh air. A place disconnected from back home. And I’m just witnessing myself feeling barely here. I feel separate from everyone except for Karol. Where is the substance in our communication? Where is the wisdom in our behavior? Why am i unable to feel for these presences? He’s constant euphoria. She’s constant attachment. The other he and she are in their own shroud. And when everyone talks i clock out, i have such little interest in the form of the dialogue. It’s thoughts expressed through memory or madness. Why do people so rarely talk about the future? Why do people so rarely demand congruity? But i know my thoughts are stuck on ideas. And they sour my being. There is jealousy, there is frustration, there is condescension. All i know is that there has been so little looking into others eyes. Some of the eyes are lacking in sympathy. With her, who i am used looking into the eyes with, our eyes move apart much quicker. And Karol, I’ve known him forever, we’ve decided long ago that is worth looking into each other’s eyes.

Vineyard
He told me to write about this time. I can but I’d need to extract particular meanings, it won’t simply be joy. We were all sitting with wine and after a few sips words flowed. On my right the romantics talking softly about frivolities. In front of me, he, expressing himself exuberantly. And on the left was she, who i mainly talked with. We spoke of her work. She works with those who have suffered severe brain damage. She helps them learn to communicate. She speaks of patients that have lost much of one of the right or left brain hemispheres, through stroke, through attempted suicide. And how if the right is lost one loses the primary language that they speak. But if they speak a secondary language, being that is located in the left, they can still speak it. She spoke of how woman have more white matter than men but less grey matter than men. She spoke of women having a larger amygdala than men, having more emotions than men. I brought up one of my constant thoughts. Men and especially these men and their love of speaking of ideas, beliefs, and concepts. And there is no practical application, this is my entire life with him, she says. I want the words i hold onto to be connected to my actual future, to be words that will be connected to a physical action in the future. Ideas and concepts, perhaps even beliefs can be figured out on the fly if life requires them from me. And then the attached lady moved to a new chair and i hoped that the conversation of the group would take an interesting turn. Someone asks, what makes a woman a woman? I go, this is a bit crude but the first thought is that they have a vagina and breasts. And then, the most predictable, worn out conversation ensues - gender politics. And these two men next to me only have opinions that would, if they had any influence in the world, cause them to immediately be shunned from liberal society. So, with disappointment, i return to her. And she says, you set yourself up for that. Why do these two only know how to hold dark net or conspiracy theory-like opinions, i wonder. And then i am telling her about my past, and she is doing so in return. And one of the lovers goes, you’re opening up to her, why do you never open up to me? He likes to answer his own question, so he goes, it’s just how you treat woman. And the other goes, is it? Perhaps, i say. But I’m thinking, the romantic one does not know how to listen without judging and you, i barely know you and find it so hard to look in your eyes - to feel as if you can accept my truths. And i wonder where these thoughts come from and how limiting they are. But it feels like such a truth, intellectually. And a battle worth fighting for. But i know not how, i don’t see steps that can be taken, i barely see anything more than fleeting ability to manifest this in others - even myself. And all I’ve been doing is going quiet. While in the past I’d have these thoughts, shitty thoughts, but now i count my breaths and still have thoughts but am much more aware of when they are shit. And I’m just quiet emotion during these times, hoping to either change the moment i am in or to leave it. I worry, what can i do? Must i accept it and live on? Must i slowly let these people go? Must i leave this place I’ve been, start fresh?

A volunteer
At the pantry he was just standing there. A very proper looking man. Clean cut, well fitting workwear. The place was a warehouse, large crates all over, forklifts moving here and there. And we had to move somewhere else, while in the car, the quiet man began to open up. Living in Staten Island, in the coast guard, an electrician. But he travels from time to time when heads of state need security. His unit is literally in charge of taking care of boats with weapons and other tools used to protect people like the president. He has, many times, been a part of this reality. And we arrived at the next pantry, which was a literal pantry, people coming, grabbing food, going home. And they separated me and this man to organize heave boxes of beans, cans of tuna. And we talked a bit more. Such a lonely, such a pure soul. He’s been volunteering weekly for years. He appears to have next to no friends. Never the man to go to the bar, even when it was the only thing to do during his winters in Alaska. He’s spent a lot of time on the sea. Boats where almost all were men, never for him a woman. And i see no sadness in his eyes. I just see contentment, acceptance of his reality. We move some other boxes around, boxes to the pantry, boxes of bread into the fridge. Then we go. We take the train together. He’s from Oregon, a small town of 11000 people. His mother is from Panama, his father comes from white farmers. He plans to settle down one day in British Columbia. Why? It is the only home he knows. He studied marine biology. He worked for a number of years for NOAA. On boats in Alaska that farmer high end fish, he had to inspect the ship, make sure that they followed sustainable fishing practices. He grew unsettled, desired a more settled life - a pension - he joined the coast guard. He worked for a number of years on the west coast. On big boats that searched for little fast boats that travelled from Mexico full of drugs through intel. These boats would speed by in the dark of night going full speed to their destination, some are even partially submarines. He loved working there, those boats were old, 50 or so years old, and when something was wrong with them it was a real problem to solve, even at times he would have to make the parts himself. Now, the parts you just order, slip them on, these modern boats to protect these modern presidents. He spoke of a simple refuge, at times they would park in the gulf and swim, jump and dive off the boat. The rest of the time there was so much work but he was happy on that boat of 100 or so fellow soldiers. He dreams of becoming an officer, even if that means he has to start from the lowest rank. Content to be climbing the military ladder. And he’s content living this life, i see no misgivings in his eyes. He’s heading home now, the rest of the day will be simple - a coffee shop, a movie, rest. And he will volunteer again soon, see a new part of this city, he needs not see much further. He’s content, his behavior is pure, his work is good, América trusts him, society will not wrong him.

Leaving him
Do you know?
If it weren’t for the baby, this would have happened long ago. I was so sick and tired of my job. I was afraid my whole life would pass me by. Do you know everyday i lock myself in the study I keep thinking about poetic lines. They help me forget about my pain. Forget about the baby i lost. You still don’t get it. You’ll never understand. Every time you either misunderstand me or scold me. Maybe i haven’t been fair to you. But… but i know what kind of life i need. When we got married, i thought it would be a new beginning. Trying to have a baby, i thought that would be a new beginning too. Trying too write a novel, i was hoping it would be a new beginning. My decision to leave you, I’m also aiming for a new beginning. What’s the point of me telling you all this? Do you understand? All you know are ordinary routines. Day in and day out… it’s just repetition. I lock myself in that little study everyday. I want to escape from all that repetition… tedious repetitions. Do you understand? You don’t! This is our biggest difference. This is why!

My mom never loved my dad
I never really loved him, she said. I never really thought i did. There was never understanding, he always had this way of taking that put me down. I remember, even after giving birth, he would say such horrible things as - i could have done that better than you, he said he could have given birth better than me. I remember, soon after we begun dating, i wanted to end it. But, i felt so lost, felt as if there was nothing better to do with my life. I looked at all the options but i couldn’t see what to do with my life. So i went back with him. You need to understand, i liked to party, i liked to have fun and we did a lot of that. More than a lot of others around us, we went to the city, we saw a lot in life. But, it never felt right with him. He had this way of making me feel like i wasnt even there when we hung out with others. This dismissive way about him, as if he didn’t care for me. We had so little understanding. You saw how our relationship was, always arguing, never happy with one another. It’s just we never had it, we never had love. I see it sometimes, rarely in my friendships. They have it, their lynchpin is a sexual act while there’s is contentment, they have an understanding. But i wonder if things would have been better if we only had more space, you see how little space we’ve had in this house, always right next to each other, no privacy. And the next day, presumably after she drank some wine, she texts me saying how she needs to leave the town she raises us in and she still lives in. I’ve been telling her this forever. If only it were simple, if only it were simple to find a place one can be content in, a body one can love their entire life.

Marriage for citizenship
We were talking sparingly on a dating app for a week or so, maybe a message a day. All the messages were so very monotone. I like this, i like that, i decided to just be simple like that as well. On her profile, she stated, i have autism. And her messages, always tinged with sadness, i haven’t seen my family in china for years. Things like that. One day she messages me, i have covid. And just condolences, sad faces. And then one day she messages me, in a panic, i didn’t get my work visa, i don’t know what to do, i think i need to find someone to marry. And just more sad faces, and i hope things get better for you, i hope you figure this out. And then later that day, the day right after Christmas, you want to have a fire at my place and I’m worried because she probably still has covid but it’s omicron and I’m so tired of missed opportunities, so i go. She says to bring some wood, i get some wood. I arrive, she’s on a busy road, a quite ugly and beat up street - not the prettiest part of town. And i go in, she’s got nude photos everywhere of mainly Asian woman in woods, in odd places and positions. My place is partly a gallery she says. And the place is quite dirty, she doesn’t spend next to anytime cleaning. And she has a fat little black cat. The backyard is also a mess, vines and weeds all over, a wire so low that it bumps into my headr, garbage hear and there. And she looks fine, a bit of a mess as well, such a mess of hair. But other than that, she seems cool and fun enough. There’s a fire. And we start talking, mainly about our pasts, with constant reminders of her troubles. She’s not great at eye contact, i notice, but she gives a good look at me when i look away and am talking. She looks with intensity, she listens. She mentions being in a band while living in Philadelphia, sleeping with two of the band mates, ending their broship. She speaks of her relationship with a married older orthodox Jewish man and how they had love with one another, could talk so freely about anything with one another. She spoke of a relationship with an architect that she also met through the apps, how it ended because she told him about something that happened to her and it changed how he was with her from then on. I asked to know, she said no. And it went on like this, pleasant conversation and comfort in each other’s presence. And the next day we meet again. We have hot pot. We clean up, we have another fire. And this day, she can only think about her problems, all she can do is grasp for a solution. There’s two men I’m going to meet in the next few weeks to ask if they will illegally marry me. I am going to offer them 30k. But, first, i need my parents to help me. She’s messaging with her dad, trying so hard to convince him. Her mom wants her to come back home. Her dad wants her to come back home. And she needs their money. And they are not wealthy. Her dad had a good job, a vp for a solar company but the company went down, he lost his job. I slowly say, think how hard it must be for them to give you money, can you ever repay them in some way? She says, no i don’t think i ever can. And she continues talking about how she cannot leave. She has all sorts of normal reasons. All my friends are here, the only life i know is here (she’s been here since she became an adult), the politics of china, the life in china. And obscure reasons - i cannot smoke weed there, they don’t treat autistic people right there, the Uighers. And my role is as a listener. To understand, not to express an opinion or experience unless she wants one. The basic fact is that she does not want to return to her country of birth and she will make sure that this happens.

Monopoly
Created by a woman, was tested for many years simply by people playing it. A man who was playing one day got his secretary to write all the rules and he one day patented the game. The woman who created it received much less money than he did.

Legos
Invented by a man in Denmark. A small town. He started off by making them with wood. But the wood factory burned down and he switched to plastic. People thought he was crazy for creating these things. But now, the small town where he lived has now become the second biggest city in Denmark.

Grand theft auto
Created by scots. The game was originally to be played as a policeman cleaning up the city. The main original logistical problem was creating what is called the sandbox. A world that can interacted with, a city. But then they realized it was terribly boring playing as a policeman and decided to change it to the opposite.

Tetris
Created by a Russian man that always liked math and puzzles. And he had a job working with computers but felt very bored from his work. But he gained computer skills and started using those skills to make games with them.

God frowns on those that are predictable

I already know the trouble I’m in, but I’m committed to it. We are talking, constantly, about what this means to our future. It’s a temporary refuge, we continually say. But it keeps getting more explicit. I arrived and she was preparing an elaborate meal. Handmade vegetable dumplings, some frozen pork and corn dumplings, interesting greens, and a cucumber salad. All with sauces from mystical Chinese-lettered jars that taste so good. And we sit. She tells me to say grace. Reluctantly i say something like, god help us to make sense in the confusion we are putting ourselves in, let this person and this person find progress in the realities they are in, i give thanks to the farmers and the shippers and those that have cooked this food - you - and the time that you put into preparing the food, lord i thank you for all you do. And we eat. Finish eating. The couch is too small, let’s bring that humongous footstool as an extension. And then you do something and i lay down on my back. Then you are massaging my face, my head, my arms, my shoulders - and the whole time my eyes are closed. You lay down, and we are cuddling, talking. Soon after you are licking my ear and this is the fastest things have ever happened between us. Next thing i know we are kissing. Next thing i know you are telling me my pants are not comfortable. Next thing i know i am in my underwear. And I’m aroused. You’re touching it. Rubbing, tugging it. And i think, well, she initiated it, I’ll do the same for her. She’s moaning and I’m almost finished but she crinkles her legs to stop me. Let’s watch a movie, she says. What’d you wanna watch? Something romantic she says, so for a bit we’re looking, and she remembers a movie - the handmaiden, let’s watch that. I think, sure i won’t love it but I’ll let you dictate the mood. We’re watching the movie. And i had no idea that this movie was partly soft core porn. Next thing i know i see two woman having intense sex, and one of the woman oddly looks very much like a new friend. When this scene comes on we go slowly back into the same sequence, her hand touching , me touching hers. And the same story, her moaning and me close but not finished. And we watch on. It’s almost finished. The women in the film have triumphed, and again, a scene. Her mouth on hers, her mouth on hers. And hers on hers. And our hands are back and our scene is back and the same conclusion but this time the mouth, and it’s a bit teethy, but i think this likely won’t last long, i must imagine, so i think of the women in the film and moments later I am finished. We are cleaning up. The rest of the night is a blur. My spirit is in shock. We’ve taken it this far. There is no longer innocence. We now know so much of one another.

A night
She was there. So the night started at 230. We were to play football then. And we did. And it was the same as it always was. Running, maneuvering, yelling - around a ball. And the game ended. 4 out of the 14 of us went for a drink. All in their 40’s and i. The conversation started trivially. And then, one said - my father died last week.

78 years old. Healthy. He was going to see him for New Years. He lived in DC. He always had a good relationship. But a heart attack. He spoke of how his father had been speaking of death, of his willingness to die. Of the fact that the week before his death he brought emptied his car of what was in it. He saw his father several times each year. His mother is in Egypt, his father in the states. He spoke of how every day his father would call his mother and sing to her. How, that day, he did not. How a few months ago for a celebration his father made a 45 minute speech. He spoke of how, on Christmas, he called his father and his family and his wife and immediate family spoke to him - wishing him a merry Christmas - and the last thing he said to them was that he loves them.

Then another spoke of his dead father. He died about 3 years ago. It was a prolonged death, happening over several years. It was horrible, the slow, prolonged death.

He was an angry man. He did not trust medicine. He was in pain for a while until it was unbearable, so he saw a doctor. It was colon cancer. The doctor said he either had a few weeks to live or surgery. The surgery would force him to have to be cared for. He chose death. I saw him the last few days. The doctor said it would be a few days but he lived for more than a week more.

And then we went back to trivialities. Football. How can i play better? Anticipate the ball, he says, when it comes - know what to do with it. And some go and some arrive. And now there is a lady in our presence. And the conversation continues. Nothing too deep. One knows how to get deep temporarily, another explains all the time, another either says something obscene or explanatory or nothing. And I’m just floating, trying to figure out what it is I’m doing. The girl says, i wanna go to this dive bar near by. And i think. A new dive bar, why not? And we go and the same story. But the girl is across from me and her hand reaches for my hand and we caress a bit. Conversation about her growing up in hawaii. Insane questions by the posturing slightly deep old one. The third sense of a relationship. The first and second being the perspectives of the two. The third being the shared experiences, or so i presume by his words. But bar conversation does not stay on the same topic for long. And i reach for her arm as she seems open to touch. She’s 38, 7 years older than me. She worked many years as a nature photographer in Portland. She’s traveler so much. She can partially speak many languages. She’s aware. She’s cute. And it’s time to go. So we walk outside, just the 3 of us left. To her bike, and we part with a hand grasp and we do some sort of back and forth from my body to hers holding each other’s hands. And then i go. I open my phone, open the app to rent a bike, and shes calling me. I pick up, come back she says. I’m only a block away. I’m in front of her and what else is more right to do then to kiss. So we do. And we talk sweet nothings. We walk. We speak of this and that - softly. What do you feel, she says. Giddy, this is so unexpected. We stop. We kiss. It’s good, it’s so good. We keep walking. I feel like with you there was awareness, i felt as if you had a sense of when the conversation was off in the group, when things were separate from reality - i liked that about you - i said. And we kiss more, for a longer time because i will turn left, she will bike home. We do tender things - nose to nose, kisses on the cheeks, loving hugs, thankful for each other words. I hope to see you soon, i say. You have my number, text me - she says. And we depart. She texts me that night - was quite nice to finally actually meet you. Likewise, i say.

Woman
Tuesday on 1/4 i saw her at the tiki bar.
Wednesday on 1/5 i saw kyle at the turtle bar.
Friday 1/7 snow day.
Saturday i volunteered and then saw my mum then had fire with Ashley
Sunday i played soccer and went over Ashley’s house
Monday
Thursday saw Ashley and another fire
Friday saw Nuomin and had fire

New memories are impossible to forget while they are happening. She showed up a couple nights prior. Friend of friends. And the romance was genuine, undeniable, genuine. I was on my way towards her neighborhood, trying hard to figure out what it is that this was, what the first instance of us being alone would be like. And we’re there, at a tiki bar, im drinking a margarita, facing taxonomical photos of birds. To the left, a giant and vivid painting of a snake slithering. Tropical plants. And she’s talking about growing up in Hawaii. And the conversation keeps revolving back to our shared acquaintances. Another pair arrives into our periphery. A hard to not look at pair. A man sexy, great hair, exotic, strong, intense eyes, black. A blond woman, young, sexy body, beautiful face, hip style. And her hands move onto him much more than he does, a man wary of his attraction, conceding to a woman’s desire. We move closer to one another and are touching, a kiss. And the conversation becomes more personal, more tender, more about previous relationships. She spoke of her ex bf of a number of years. They were to be married. He cheated on her with an 18 year old. And then things simply became strange. She wanted a break from him. But he would just show up at her place, say things that made no sense. His family would come, and also say things that made no sense to her. It felt insane, she said. She doesn’t understand this point of her life. She’d took all of 2021 off dating. We met January 3rd. During this we went elsewhere. Another bar with turtles. A bar full of objects. Objects of bar antiquity. A vibe, a heavy dive bar vibe. 4 dollar Narraganset, 4 dollar 20 oz buds. And more kissing, more tenderness. And we go towards her place, only a block away. And she has work to do but she’s kissing me all over my face, my ears, and I’m excited, i suggest to come up but it’s not time, not yet. And we depart. I bike home, anticipation.

And the next day, things have been broken with my friend. And he wants to meet, to hang out, to see one another. Fresh on my mind was yesterday, so i thought why not go back to the turtle bar. And we decide to walk there. And my life has been revolving around woman, from dating apps, from reality, and so did my words. We arrive at the bar, and we start to drink. He is a man of particular opinions, especially regarding relationships. Sex is something sacred, he says, it changes everything between two people. It’s best to wait. It’s best to hold off, or else you will compromise your ability to truly connect with the other. And we speak of our writing, he wrote something recently, influenced by nietzsche, very full of ideas, hard to understand pictures. And my writing, about a man i met while volunteering. He said my writing was full of pity towards this man. And on and on, beers upon beers. Negativity replaced by positivity, male masculinity replaced by acceptance. And we left. He got a cab, i biked. At home, i google about sex before marriage, and the study says that those that wait statistically have a better marriage.

An early morning

One day i want to know what love is. I see those around me, running chaotically as chickens who have been relieved of their heads. I can only imagine that this is love. Such confusion cannot be anything else. I wont accept it. For a long time I have forbid myself from entertaining such things. I refuse silliness. But my heart beckons towards a shadowy maiden veiled in the smoke of tomorrow. She whispers to me these silly things. Maybe from her I can begin to understand.

# 1/28

How happy am i? 8 out of 10, i told her. Positives and progress in many directions but i feel, day by day, less in control of my life. With another, i said, more of the same - content but my love life is a bit of a mess. 13 days, for the last 13 days I’ve felt as if my life has not been my own. But it’s fine, it means that I’ve been able to get lost in the world, in a world that others have created with me and, partially, for me.

The women of the first week happened in such confusing succession. The first came out of nowhere, friend of friends. And we were smart about it, several meetings - no sex. And another it had built up and sex had become the norm. And the finally, brand new and beautiful and full of modernity. Beginnings always hit you with such vigor. And it was, just about, three beginnings at once.

The first woman, the beginning was so poetic. And her world has a shape i crave. It revolves around nature. Constant hikes, backpacking, van living. She has a home to go to in Hawaii. She kisses well. She’s funny. She speaks multiple languages. She has curves, well shaped breasts. But she’s older and her face bares it. And her taste in things, we lack commonality. There is an obsession with a band called spoon. There is her veganism. There is this constant kindness. But above all there is no deep look, no deep thoughts protruding from her. And now, only a few weeks later, i feel disinterested.

The one where things built up, we’ve already spoken about how we do not see something long term between us. But she speaks of wanting to be friends for the long run. I say yes but deep down i feel doubt. A friends ex, and she kept wanting to see me so i started seeing her. The first time we hung out we kissed, almost had sex. The second time oral sex. And it’s been a few times of sex since. We switch between my place and hers but hers is preferable. It’s good with her. The conversation is rarely trivial. We read what we write to one another. We massage one another. She brings out oils and lotions, hot towels and facial masks. And we watch good movies. We smoke occasional cigarette’s. We eat well, she cooks great. She looks great when dressed. But without clothe there’s a bit to be desired. But she’s working on it. I’ve known her for so long, we’ve learned to accept one another’s faults. She asked me what I look for in a woman, and i thought of a woman i barely know - beautiful, odd, funny mannerisms, definitively cool. And now, thinking about what i said it makes me think that I’m searching for as much of myself as can fit in a woman. Suppose that makes some form of sense. We can, perhaps, learn more about ourself through spending time with those quite like us. But so many say that opposites attract or the like, and - this is a stretch - this may be a reflection of one not fully loving their self. And this is me trying to explain why i cannot see this woman as a partner. It’s this sense of what is right for me as well as her. Intuition. And we’ve both spoke of why we cannot see it working. But when she says what she is looking for she speaks of someone like me. So, while she won’t admit it, i sense she wants me as a partner. She knows I’m seeing others but speaks as if she wants to see no one else. Any man she dates or that asks her out, i wonder, that she sees me and others like me as an ideal she compares them with and if they are not like this she rejects them. And she had not had sex with anyone for almost 2 years prior to me. And she says such wild things as that she wants our friendship to last til the end. This relationship, while it has such healthy behavior baked into it, will one day hit a point where things will go sour. And i am the problem, not she, i am the one holding her life in a standstill while she is progressing my perspective, strengthening my ability to be a lover. I can only hope I’m doing the same.

The brand new one. Had no idea what to expect. She came to my apartment the first time i met her. I made some flatbread before she came, the first time in years, because she wanted focaccia bread. So the first time we interacted with one another was in my kitchen. And she’s wearing perfume and looks great. And her next to me, leaning near me, casual touches - excitement could not help being felt. And we went outside to make a fire. And i realised quite quickly she has maturity. Easy to chat with and the way of talking had a certain shape and color that was comforting. We spoke of therapy, of cognitive behavioral therapy which she’s been doing for a number of years. Of her ex who she was recently dating for two years. She moved to Texas with him, onto a military base. That one day she heard that he cheated on her while he was in Miami and she packed up and left while was still there, moved back to the city (she went to nyu) about 6 months ago. Started fresh, got a new job, and she now says that she doesn’t see herself settling down for a number of years. She spoke of her father. Who’s been married 5 separate times. How she is his oldest child, with his first wife, her mother. How they’re from Mongolia. How they both got a phd in Japan, where she was born. Then moved to the states together. How she was then mainly raised by her mother. How her mother cherishes her, that they are very close, and were just on a vacation together in Mexico. That she is not very close with her father. About how she mainly grew up in Westchester. All this and more was said in front of the fire. And we started to kiss. And i really liked how she kissed. And then we decide to go upstairs. And i setup the bed with the monitor and put on a movie. The cat is in the room and the door is closed so she sits by the foot of the bed and watches us. We barely watch the movie. All of the attention is on one another. One article of clothing after another comes off. She is wearing this very sexy shirt, form fitting, no bra. Nipple piercings. And she goes down on me but when i try to do the same for her she says she doesn’t like that, it’s too stimulating, she says. And after sex we speak of how she sees herself as more of the giver than the taker. And we agree, that perhaps, this is why she doesn’t like it. And next time we say. And it’s hard for her to cum. But she still seems happy, her sex drive is not extraordinary, it appears, and shes so candid about everything. I mention that last year i had not had sex all of the year, that i was not dating. And moments later she says, the thought of what you said is driving me crazy, there hasn’t been 3 weeks straight since I’ve been an adult that i had not had sex. And we are just talking about this and that for hours and we check the time, it’s 3am, life moved so fast so unexpectedly. And the decision had been made before the night began she’d go home to sleep, so she went.

This was a Friday night, the next day i saw a friend i haven’t seen for some time. We sat in the coffee shop that i like to write in. He worked on something related to programming, i wrote of one of the woman within this story. And his lady friend came and he decided to mock my writing by putting down a paragraph, creating a caricature of my practice. But the hideous part was that he thought it was a replication of how i write. Such delusion. And she came and read it and laughed so much, and i hated the both of them for this. A grudge. And we went to my place and it was all so very not anything special. We made pizza. He bickered. He spoke his built up words, i made up words to counter. And then crying, and i must go home. And just me and her for a bit. And we are confused as all has also been odd btw the two of us. And she departs.

Ski trip

We left 6 in the morning. Me and billy. He drove. He first spoke of family. How his girlfriends parents basically gave them this brand new car. How his parents live in the Rockies, right near amazing ski resorts. He spoke of his cousins house in Maryland, on the beach, but in this odd place where dead animals come to shore. And then about his work, he’s been working at Facebook for nearly 10 years. His recent ambition to be a manager. And he went on and on about the nuances of this, it consumes him. The team is expected to double in the next year, and the current manager needs another, he is the choice. Less coding, more people managing. Getting closer and closer to Vermont. And it’s been raining but the more north we get the rain slowly becomes sleet to snow. A heavy snow. The roads are suspect at best and our car is not made for this. So we go slowly. We leave the main road to a more remote one for the final 30 or so miles to the ski resort. And the roads become more and more dangerous. Billy is looking desperately for a place to buy chains for the tires. He stops at a store but no chains. The only ones being 20 or so miles back from us. We know that the storm will be rough for most of the skiing then end when we leave so the main thought is that if we get there the driving will be much easier when we go. And then we turn to a much more remote road for the last 5 or so miles. And it’s up and down hills. We hit a road where we cannot get up. The wheels turn but we do not move. We try and try, other cars stop repeatedly to give us suggestions, voice concern. We get out, move the snow here and there in front and behind the wheels, and a little push of the car. And after a few times of doing this it moves, the wheels get traction and we get over the hill. We are getting so close but all it is is up and down one hill after the other. Momentum from going down is necessary to get back up. Billy understands the uses of all the different gears which he uses perfectly. And amazingly, we arrive. We unpack, we dress, we get the gear on and the ski day begins. It’s beautiful, fresh snow everywhere. The mountain is not huge and our day cannot be long as we began quite late. We head to a side of the mountain with old lifts and great terrain. Countless places to ski in the trees. An idyllic route. The whole way down the mountain, in the trees, with countless possible directions. Several hundred square feet to traverse the whole way down, we wind down the path, continually stopping to take it in. The pines are white, covered in snow, the trails are powdery, full of freshly fallen snow. Up the lifts, all is white, the sky, the trees, the trails. So desolate, so monotone, so serene, so raw. And hours of this until we go. To the house we are renting. Where we saw the rest of the group, arriving at the same time as we. We settle into the place, we take it in - the hot tub, the pool table, the friendly faces. Laziness then tacos then drinking and games and pool. Drunken revelry. Sleep.

The people at the house were people i played soccer with on and off for a number of years in Brooklyn. I dreamt last night of playing football with them. But in the dream it was not they who were playing, it was their children and we were the onlookers. They are older men, and while none of those present had children, others in the group in Brooklyn were having more and more and one could see in a few years the ones present will have their own. Men past their prime, settling down, young angst overcome - men settling down. At the start of the trip there was 10 of us, 3 couples, one of the mens sister and mother, me and billy. The three couples hang out often outside of football. Billy as well. I know them pretty well but not great.

Jay and Cata. Jay, the lynchpin of the group. He booked and set up the lodging. He’s the everyman, close to everyone their. It’s his mother and sister there. Very athletic but currently injured so stuck in the house and cannot ski. He drinks all day, and his personality is everywhere all of the time. The one we all gravitate to. The best pool player, the frequent dj, the name that gets called out repeatedly. Cata, a true character, full of personality. There’s a certain regality to her. She expresses herself, she tells stories, all in such an engaging way. Just like Jay, she talks to everyone, she fits into any mold with ease, she belongs everywhere. And their dog is there, Dante. A chichiwawa. Another strong personality, plays with aggression, demands attention, lays wherever he wants - characterized by a direct and hard look.

Jay’s sister and mother, Melissa and Barbara respectively. Likable but stereotypical of Long Island. And this is the only time I’ve met them. So i know both so much less than the rest. Barb i heard much more from thanks to a good amount of time being in the hot tub in groups with her. Quite like Jay, very conversational and full of stories. But her stories, focused on the exciting, murders and the mafia. But can barely put together a coherent thought of the two of them. It’s a sad fact in life, one’s inherent prejudice, and how it clouds one’s memories of certain individuals, rendering them incoherent.

Dave and Jess. The U.K. man in his 40’s and a woman in her mid 20’s. A relationship quite difficult to reconcile. They seem happy but their personalities are so obviously different. Dave, a well spoken man with a London accent. Always with a joke quick on his tongue, typical uk wit. While Jess is from rural Pennsylvania, a whiny voice, a tendency for being taken care of, a life she is still putting together. And he’s settled in his life and job, while she’s still in school and has seemingly never had a serious job. But it’s hard to make sense of what they have with one another. Though, how frequently that is the case with relationships we witness. It’s a gamble, a decision that two have made.

Steve and Melody, the couple of 10 years, and they are barely 30. The two that have so settled into domestic life that they bring it to the trip. Most dinners are made by them, breakfasts as well. Snacks brought by them, popcorn and an assortment of Trader Joe’s snacks. They’re the ones seemingly most put together, attached to modern times. Pescatarian’s. She organizes yoga. She’s frequently reading and composed and meditative. He’s mainly the same and when he works, so professional, a man direct and organized in his thoughts. Rarely does he lose his composure, but he’s with the boys, and they are drinking theirselves to death, so he does the same.

And the week goes with this reality. Jay, injured and not working but drinking all day with his mum, Dave, and whoever has that day off work, until the night for others to join. A peaceful house we are all trying to find our place within. Working some days, skiing others. And the days were so cold that when we would go into the hot tub here our hair would freeze. We would look up around the hot tub and see spider webs frozen. We would speak of what happens to the spiders, they cannot live outside but they find a way. We play hours upon hours of pool, that crisp clack and that endless curiosity - what will happen next? Games. Simple and fun ones, code names and fishbowl and more. And dinners around the dining table, with cheers and thanks to the ones that cook for us and for all of us being with one another during this trip.

And the skiing. During the week it was so cold and i was so ill dressed that the experience lost so much of its wonder. But on Saturday, i found myself out once again with Billy. And just as on Monday, we wandered to an obscure part of the mountain. Full of black and double black diamonds and an assortment of tree trails, and with the fresh snowfall and peoples frequent avoidance of the trees - they were full of fluffy snow. So for hours we’d have our little portion of the mountain. Step by step, our little ski hike. Wide trails in the trees. Where one could go far to the left or right and stop, take it all in, map out the next path to take. The part of the mountain was a quiet, efficient area. We did about three lifts the entire time we were there, each run would take almost an hour, often this being my fault bc I’d fall and take a good amount of time getting myself back up. And for the lifts they put their best workers so it was a well oiled machine and the beginners were not there falling getting on and off the lift. And on the last run a scare, we see a man down a hill on the trail destroyed. Medics around him, strapping him to a sled, a neck brace on, no sign of movement, friends dejectedly near. It was down a steep hill, one can imagine him zipping down and a trip, a fall, a collision with a tree. So we move slower, and we pray within that this horror is not as terrifying as we imagine. But we find our way, as slowly and as thoughtfully as we can. And one last lift before heading back to the base where others are waiting. And we cannot help but be glad that we were where we were, as the trails back are icy, and we see more medics with people beat up as we go. I fall here and there but more out of nervousness than anything, people in all directions, constant fear of a collision. Stress abounds. And we find our way back, to the fire at the base where we could relax and take refuge in the comfort of our memories within the trees.

The trip was for me, more than anything about getting to know these folks i barely knew. Myself surrounded by the question of friendship and my place within their lives. It is so hard to read the future but the sense is there that this trip and others like it, gatherings in Brooklyn can become a much more frequent occurrences. A few steps past being friends that play football together and get a few drinks after. A shared history.

Jay

Figure out what it is he did prior. A man that liked his work from a previous job decided to teach him how to DJ. This is what he would do while in school. Just a few days a week, but get paid almost 500 dollars a night. Countless weddings, birthdays, celebrations. He went to school for nursing but he waited some time prior to actually look for work, content to continue working as a dj. Soon after getting a nursing job he met a nurse anesthesiologist who told him about the high life that he was living. If he goes back to school for a couple years he could get certified to do the same. A life where all you really do is put people to sleep, one’s certified to do so are in such high demand that in some states one could make thousands upon thousands a day as a contractor. A cushiony job that is a ton less stressful than a normal registered nurse. So he went down this path and has been doing this work for over a dozen years. He spoke of what his day to day looks like. During surgery, he puts the patient to sleep or a part of their body, and he waits, watches the vitals, hangs out while the surgeons get to work. He mentions an anecdote, the surgeons have no sense of time he says, whenever they say 15 more minutes it tends to be an hour or so longer for the procedure. He told a story, the senior anesthesiologist’s have no idea what they are doing as they do not keep up with modern practices - one day one came to setup a patient to go under - and it is occasionally difficult to get the tube down their throat that gives oxygen so they need to get some tools out to try and force it down there, and it very rarely happens that a tooth or two is a casualty of this process, this time being a case of this. He’s never lost a patients tooth. But it must be quite a shock, to awake, missing a tooth when the procedure had nothing to do with the patients mouth. He’s planning to follow the path of anesthesiologist’s that do contracts in states where they sorely need them. He shows up for a short time, makes bank and goes home. So he can retire sooner than later. Settle down in peace.

## 2/5

Dates

When in search, when craving for another, and when it is so easy to get them in your presence, why say no to their want to see you? Most say the reason they date an assortment is bc they like to meet new people. To me, it was as simple as me wanting to use my energy in some way, explore a different way of living life. So i saw 5 different people over 6 days. Some from tinder and others from hinge.

The first was Mel, no expectations or truly much of a desire to meet her but it seemed more fun than hanging out with my friends so i departed from them early to meet her. She’s from china but has been living in the states a number of years, the regular story - staying after obtaining her masters. She worked at vice and now at nbc. She told me a bit about the world of video production. Being newish in the field she mainly works as an editor, she is given a bunch of film and she uses software to grab the audio and visual snippets requested by her seniors. She spoke of, as she is Chinese, a lot of her work has to do with Chinese content, predictably. And, now that the Beijing Olympics are about to start she has a more hectic schedule. She works Beijing hours. Early morning to afternoon for the first shift, late at night for the second, two in a single day. She spoke of her cat, how it has a genetic disease that makes it prone to heart illness. How it ended up in the hospital for days. How this cost over 10 grand. How she has to give the cat medicine multiple times a day. How if this happens again she’ll have no choice but to let it die. Just like what we will let happen between the two of us.

The next day was Jelena. She wanted to go to a pretty bougie place and i thought why not. We’d been chatting for a couple weeks and it was about time to meet. This was the day after a snow storm so the walk would be a bit dangerous but tranquil, barely anyone in the streets, white all around, so i did the long walk. And then i was there and she soon showed up. Tbh, i was disappointed, her photos made her look better than she looked in person. She looked ok but not particularly desirable. She was fine to chat with, albeit a bit too prone to speak of obscure psychology subjects, to ask particular questions that she had predefined judgements for regarding my answers. She’s from Cleveland. Her parents are immigrants from Austria. A pretty strong personality. She spoke of attachment types. How she is anxious, after a few minutes of discussion it appeared she thought i was avoidant. But that was the supposed type of her ex and it appears she cannon stop thinking of this type, as if it’s the foundational idea of her doomed relationship. She spoke of the importance of knowing thyself, and me, being me, spoke of confusion, how i am quite confusing but this was a joke. It annoys me when people define other selves so particularly, so fast, without thinking of who they can be with the person next to them - my optimistic side hoping for the best in others, not to say i could see any form of future with her. It went on, a bit more jokingly. But the place, the conversation, i knew this is not ideal for the both of us. And she is from hinge, looking for something serious and it could not be.

The next day there was no date but one learns from those they date. With jelena, we spoke of my writing practice, of my desire to go to the cafe before work for an hour or so - which i did this day. We spoke of doing proper meditation, which i am prone to failing at as I would look at my phone and not observe myself properly, and i made a more conscious effort to do so this day. We spoke of my ideal nightly ritual - incense, dimmed lights, relaxing music, a good drink by my side, all while reading - which i did this day. I even went to bed at a reasonable time. One is influenced by those they date.

And on Tuesday i had begun chatting with another woman the day prior, Siri. She worked at one of the more unique cultural spots in this city, pioneer works in red hook. So we started off chatting about this and that. But i mention a fire, as a kind of hook, to see if that is a first date possibility, if she’s willing to debauch from the beginning. And we agree on a drink nearby and, if things go well, a fire. So we meet and she’s a bit less than expected but she’ll do. A young woman, 24, from upper westchester. She speaks with a certain easiness, a very Manhattan-like accent. Across the bar is a man I’ve seen so often on my block, a character, and i see he has a rapport with the bartender - this is his space. And we finish and go back to my place. A small meal then opening of the wine then a fire. The conversation meandered here and there. Little stories, images. She spoke of how no one works hard at her job. She spoke of the owner of pioneer works showing up on a little electric scooter every day, dressed eclectically, a successful artist with an enigmatic personality. She spoke of her family being from Norway - which i found oddly prescient as i was reading a travel book where the author was just then travelling in Norway. All while, though at least half a foot shorter than me - she sat on an elevated chair looking down at me. And after more wine and fire, it seemed the right time to kiss. Lips on lips, a bit mouthy of a kiss but it’ll do. And touch and finishing of the package of wood and into my room we go. And after settling down i sit. She moves to me and is on me kissing so aggressively. Everywhere and so overwhelmingly. And one step after the next, sex then more sex. And it’s late and i let her sleep over. I lay on my back to sleep, you look like a corpse, she says. And we awake and once again we’re at it, it’s fine, it’s not dull. And she goes, we both have to work. So I get her a cab. No plan to see her again, but there is a yearning, a sense that, with her, this can so easily be repeated. She even left me an unwanted gift, a hickey.

The next day was with another woman I’d been talking to for weeks. An Asian woman from London, Anita. The intrigue began as we both had an interest in skiing, but more then that, skiing in the trees. And the same time we began to chat i was in Vermont, on a ski trip. One always has to make this and that up during these online chats so it often fizzles out but it went fine with her. So we eventually set a date. We’d meet at this wine bar near me, get a drink. We showed up but it was full with a wait so we went to this Spanish spot nearby instead. And she was easy to chat with, easy on the eyes, easy to listen to. Wholesome conversation. About family, about habits, about interests - interspersed with funny. Perhaps it’s a character very frequently developed by those from London, an ability to banter. She’s told me about her trip to Hawaii. A story. How on the first day there they did a treacherous hike and they severely underestimated how long it would take. So, on the way back darkness came. And only a few of them had a headlight. They found their selves off of the trail, lost, unknown how to find their way. She, being a quite assertive one, phones the police saying we may be lost and if you don’t rescue us we may perish here. She said, we may be fine though, and may not need to be rescued. And they said, we either come or don’t come. Ok give us 20 or so minutes then. So they looked for the trail, and luckily saw some other hikers headlights in the distance, so they rushed to get to them, eventually finding their selves back to the car. The car was spray painted all over, presumably bc of anger from a crappy parking job. But they accepted that, cleaned the spray paint off the window and went their way. On the way back, the road feels so bumpy, so they stop, look at the car, tires were slashed. So they left the car there for the night to pick it up the next day. This was her first day in Hawaii. And back to the bar in Brooklyn and i think i kinda like her. Perhaps it’s my type. The fact that i put woman in this box of if they are worth pursuing in the long run so immediately is insane. The look, the way of life, the way of communicating - but perhaps more than anything, it’s sadly how she looks. She’s a very healthy person. Obviously eats well, drinks sparingly, has healthy habits, exercises regularly, has an active social life. She has a great attention span. This day my body was beat up, my mind was tired after my previous night of debauch. I, insanely, had a hickey on my neck which was blatantly obvious to see. But she’d notice any sign of distress - physical, mental, spiritual - and comment on it. And all she ever did was speak positively. Though, one felt a shrew-like tendency - a hardness, a very direct and pointed emotional state, a commandeering presence. But her words were always kind, a caretaker of humanity. She asked quintessential questions that a modern and healthy woman would ask. What are you grateful for? What is your relationship with your family? And i felt so unguarded the whole time. I’d speak of my love life without details but with a backdrop of dismay. And she’d say that as long as it’s positive and healthy i see nothing wrong with that. By the end it was almost 2 and half hours together, all while nursing a single glass of wine. So, I thought, this must be a good sign, as i had already decided
that i wanted to see her again. So we left, and while outdoors it felt odd, we both felt so separate and she’d do odd little cutesies - baiii and what are you doing this weekend, ohhh ya you already said that. And we departed with a slight, emotionless hug.

I wanted to see her again, but had the sense that i needed to tread lightly. So, i thought, she spoke quite glowingly of Pilates and yoga so why not do a class within a few days then contact her. I decided on Friday night but there was only a Pilates class that fit the times that i could do, and I’d never done a Pilates class before, but still decided to do it. I showed up a bit early and saw a bunch of women getting ready to go, after finishing their last class. A tight space and me, confused as to where to put myself, the one man of a dozen or so woman. So i sat somewhere, tried to blend in. The instructor, a slouchy but young woman with a self deprecating way of expressing herself, kept asking me questions - first time here, how are you? And eventually the first wave of women go and a new wave trickles in. And I’m still extremely self conscious. So i take in the odd machine i need to work with, a machine with all sorts of springs and handles and platforms and the platform in the middle is strangely slideable. I go to one part of the room, trying to hide a bit, nearish a woman in glasses. But eventually at least half of the 20 or so machines are taken. The class starts and it’s loud music with the instructor yelling at us one instruction after the next. Motivational phrases, you got this, Jerry just like that, well done everyone, you’re almost there. And while she’s yelling this and that she has us in odd positions, for one we have our knees or our feet on a stable platform but our arms as a plank on the sliding platform and we must slowly contort our body pushing our behind up then slowly go back to a plank - then find your point of most tension and stay there she says, she says this at one point during all the different positions during this intentional torture, hold it for 30 25 20 15, etc. She literally jumps by 5 per second but the entire time you don’t know what’s happening so it does not matter. You simply are one extremely difficult body position after the next, without a break, and wondering, when will it end? But you don’t want it to end too soon, you’re paying for this. And my self consciousness gets exasperated by the woman near me, as when her butt faces me she sometimes covers it with her hands, as if, during this insanity i am capable of desiring her. And the class eventually ends and soon after the instructor gives me motivation, you did great for your first class! How do you feel? I say, lost, quite lost. But the better word would have been dazed, my mind was in my body, it had not yet returned to my mind. But the class was done, i accomplished what i went to do. I could sense that I’d be in pain for days and i surely was in pain for days. And with Anita, we’d been texting a bit before, i told her something like, I’m doing a Pilates class thanks to your inspiration, yada yada. And she replied, that’s great, yada yada. And when I’m out there was a text asking me how it was. You Pilates ladies are insane, that was insane. Then a bit more chatting, very friendly, so I thought, i will see her again. Didn’t say anything the next day but asked her on Sunday, to go out sometime the next week. A day later, she says something like it was great meeting you but i sense friend vibes, wish you the best. I reply something like perhaps we can be friends, I’m going on a trip to Vermont in a few weeks if interested. And she replies, waiitt i might be, etc. And then i had to plan a trip, so i messaged friends, put it together, and got back to her this day, this place and this is the car situation. She goes, let me think about it and i reply with kind and patient words in return, I’m having a party Saturday with people going, come if you can - i have a bday party to go to, she says. Eventually she says, I’m gonna pass. Of course, it’s hard to feel comfortable going on a trip with a person you just met but she also says that boring and stereotypical idea, been reading about too many murders recently, etc. And I’m not trying to convince her to come, just the facts and kindness and a tinge of sadness is all i express. I end by saying, maybe I’ll contact you in a few months to go surfing. She’s into the idea. So the last thing i say is, see you maybe in may lol. And she puts the little heart on it.

The next day i saw Miranda. A California girl. Film producer. Grew up in Santa Barbara, went to Berkeley. We started speaking a few weeks ago, planned to meet but put it off for a bit. Decided to go to the same spot me and Anita tried to go to the day before. There was space, we sat. She works at a company called bleaker street, which looks to focus on thoughtful American films. Found her cute but in a heady way. She spoke so clearly. She spoke of her many best friends. Of the many weddings she is going to this year, one in France, another in Mexico. Of how she watches film and tv all of the time. My memory was stuck on the woman the night before and my entire experience was shrouded in that memory. The woman was fine, and funnily enough, I’d probably have worked on seeing her again if that did not happen. She had kindness, smarts, a nice smirk but she was not what i am in search of. I spoke with one yesterday about what i am searching for. I spoke of hobbies, it’d be amazing if she liked to surf and ski. If her personality had humor, i am attracted to her, she is put together and mature. Low bar she said. And now, I stop, sitting in this cafe and writing these words, wondering and looking around me. And one can’t help but look at beauty, imagine that that beauty comes with a personality so in touch with my needs. And it’s that shallow, I can’t help but think. It’s just that, looking around a room, and saying her, i pick her. And if she is your constant her, then she is the one you want to look at, the one you want to interact with. We live in a perpetual shroud of what was and what could be, the hard thing is convincing yourself what should be and sticking with it.

On Saturday this week i saw my mum, sister, and her boyfriend. We went to see a play, Hamilton ‘c for my mums birthday. I met up with her a bit before the other two. Had a drink, spoke a bit about the fact of how much I’ve been dating then helped her set up a dating app. She told me recently she’s going on a date through it soon. Then my sis and her bf showed up, we got some sushi, spoke a bit about my sisters new job. She’s starting a program that pays for her masters degree in education, they set her up with a kind of apprenticeship at a school, set her on the path to become a public school teacher. She’s working at a charter school in queens, she’s teaching or rather learning how to teach math, she’s learning under a woman that appears to be quite beat up in age and disposition - and i feel the same a bit about my sister. She needs to watch her health more, so very slouchy, filling out in unattractive ways. We eventually went to the play, and the theatre had so much age, character, energy - its been there for nearly a hundred years and feels barely changed since then - it’s charm intact. We settled into our seats, way up the theater but the view was fine, the acoustics and sound was immersive. The play began, and me being me, I never looked up what Hamilton was remotely like. Never knowingly heard a song, heard little about it so i had no expectations. It started off as the show would be the entire way through - energetic, modern, rhythmic, symmetric, beautiful - but most of all, it was cool. Undoubtedly cool. The actors were repeatedly characterized by that word. Each full of smirks, full of dashing looks, modern anecdotes and cultural references, ideas and beliefs expresses of ‘the woke’ - but most of all, the actors with their straight faced expression, easily expressible wit, and that look, when one is conscious they just did something awesome and looks out to the world in glory. And the actors that lacked that had talent, vocal ability rare and spellbinding. And the play reaches its end, and the final message, we all make our own story - what is your story? A homage to the musicians, those hidden in the pit in front of the stage but integral to the whole. We go, out into the busy broadway street where nothing much can be done but take in the spectacle for a bit then go.

Sunday, footy day, footy and a pint. An unexpected crew once we finished. Andrew and Andy then jay showed up. A group that’s been too injured to play. All three, massive characters. Andy, with a booming voice that can take up the room, dialogue full of wit, interesting anecdotes. He’s trying to adopt a baby with his wife right now. It’s a decision that can be made when a woman is giving birth, or at times, the decision is made for you by child care. You had too many, you’ve been deemed too irresponsible, reasons as such. Andrew, not Andy just mentioned, it’s been some time since I’d seen him, and we have a comradery. The second time we met, we had drinks until the late hours on a weeknight, me, him and Jay. And he told me how, that night, while going home he fell off his bike multiple times. Bad falls. In his terms, he probably busted a rib, a slight fracture. It’s why he had not played for so long. He recently finished a masters degree at an art school, supposedly amazing at drafting. So it’s been time for him to look for work. And he recently found work, in Cleveland, Ohio. As an apprentice to an artist. He’ll be working long days painting, presumably, classy wall art for rich folks and hotels but he doesn’t have a very clear picture as of yet. But it’s a great first job as he was planning to join a union job, and after this, his resume will look much better setting him up for a better starting salary. We spoke a bit about the wall art you’d see in Williamsburg. He spoke of how that work was so simple, just line work really, in his terms. How those that do that work get paid next to nothing, usually rich kids doing a job they perceive as cool. And then it was time to go, i had to see her, told her i would, 4 drinks in. This time, we didn’t do a movie but rather decided to hang around, food and chatting and cigs and drinks and we didn’t stop having sex. Short breaks then again and again and again. And a new idea, painting together. She drew these thick lines of color interspersed throughout the canvas. Then i took the brush and made this looping, snakelike line mainly from top to bottom. More sex and cuddles and reading to one another. She has a very professional sounding writing voice, direct and convincing and precise. Perfect for non-fiction. She writes of relationships, viewing me oddly as some form of muse, my name and personality interspersed throughout the words, from top to bottom. I read her my words, she doesn’t love it, it lacks the normal poetry, rambling and factual she says. Tedious perhaps. Then it’s time to sleep. Same story, sleep then sex then i go, i stop at the little coffee shop on the way back, the one that steams the milk for your coffee, back at home and dazed, distracted to start my workday.

More dates the next week. More dates while disillusioned, confused about what it is that I’m doing. Dates and friendships expanding. We spoke of a fire this Saturday at my place with people I’ve known for a while but never had over, soccer folks, so this is in mind the whole week. And a plan for a ski trip with another group. Organising with Janice. Friendship in the background, dates in my presence. On Monday, it was too easy to meet. So we met. Carrie. Had a pretty clear sense it wouldn’t be right and it was not. But an interesting place to meet, a bar called halyards, used to go there frequently in years past. She’s from the Midwest, and looks the part. She does plays while having a day job. One woman plays. Sex and the city, all the seasons in one play. She’s traveled all over, the us, Canada, and Europe. Direct with normal vibes and one can see her fitting into any bar in the states, and talking about what people there are talking about, interacting at their beat. And me, too off kilter for her, frequently off beat. So that passed and the next day, Eleanor. A London woman. Not stereotypically pretty, big boned, a pleasant face. Instantly recognisable that she’s funny. We jumped from one story to the next with comedic touch. She spoke of (ask her about the story). She spoke of growing up in London but for summers going to Maine, where her grandparents lived. The whole ordeal of getting there. Of Walmart, how she loved Walmart so much growing up, an idealized place, countless items when the London shops had such a small selection. Of how her job is taking up all her time. Long hours every day. Her boss sending emails at 12 am expecting her to see it and respond. She works at one of those unicorn companies. Was a great time, very funny, and felt like more was to come. We departed, and she was not into meeting again. A disappointment but one has their reasons. In truth, it was hard to see me being a temporary lover with her and friendship is an ordeal among ordeals. On Friday, i saw another woman. A little Asian girl from Hong Kong, raised in Chinatown. Could tell from the first moment that she was not right, close minded, hard, she thinks before she thinks, a shroud of specific and judgemental thoughts. But it was fine, i had to do most of the talking. A boring life that she makes seem more interesting because she tries to travel frequently while working remotely. And that was that. 3 dates, all quite disappointing, which made me decide to be much more intentional in how i approach this. Not seeing someone too quick, being more particular regarding my needs. Being more honest with myself. Getting more in control of my life. Reading more again, writing more, being a better friend. So Saturday hit, my little party, a handful of footy folks came and friends outside of footy. A big fire. A relaxed time. A group of folks I’m still deciphering and the same back to me. The conversation is jumpy, joking, all over the place. What was said is barely still alive in my mind. One man, Texas Dave (to distinguish from the other Dave there, London Dave) brought his roommate who recently walked the Appalachian trail. The many pairs of shoes used, the parts less and more maintained. How the maintenance level is dependent upon how active the volunteer group is in the part of the trail. But not much else in the way of stories. Pragmatic conversation. London dave with his alluring accent. Steve with his booming and heckling voice. Texas Dave with his direct and sarcastic ways. And the people I’ve known for a long while - Jamie, Ryan, Kyle, and Janice. There but, like me, taking it all in. New voices in the same old place.

Two days later was Valentine’s Day. The day before i texted a few woman, one after not speaking to her in a while. A sexy but young woman I’ve slept with once before, and she responded on Valentine’s Day. How are you and that’s great to hear this and that and i asked if she wanted to do something. A yes then a no but let’s do something soon, i want to see you again. And the other i messaged I’d been seeing consistently for months so after a bit of back and forth we decided to meet. I reserved a table somewhere, in hindsight, thankfully she was late as sitting in that restaurant waiting i realised i hated it so i left and she eventually showed up on 5th and union in park slope. It was such a cold day, the coldest in a long while, which i waited sometime for her in, making me more and more anxious. We met, she dressed up, me - i don’t have dress clothes but tried my best. We thought it would be so hard to find a decent restaurant but saw a nice Italian restaurant after a short walk and thought to give it a go, she brought her charm and soon after, we received a table for two. Such a comforting spot. Beautiful wallpaper, interesting mixed media art, pretty people all over, all so close and so accepting of the place they were in - an excellent choice, such a lucky happenstance. We choice several dishes, black pasta, pork chop, greens, and some bread. Cocktails. All quite pleasant. We know each other so well, the conversation is funny and personal. She makes up a story after the presumably married couple that was next to us departs. They live on the west side of Manhattan. Both married to different people. One married to a wife in international relations, the other to a lawyer. Both happy in their relationships. But kids and time and life has dragged on for so long. One day, walking their dogs, they spoke and felt a spark. One dog bit up the leash of the other dog, oh I’ll buy you a new one and bring it to you. Oh, ok, whenever is good but feel free to stop by, my husbands away this weekend. And the next day when she went out, he was waiting for her but acted like it was happenstance. She dressed up, some makeup and perfume and it was night. They thought, why not walk in Central Park. They began their walk. And she stopped, we are back in the restaurant. Some desert then we go. And we are holding hands on the way back to my place. She hadn’t been there in some time. In my room, i make the bed, i put on a movie and it’s only one thing on our mind, and it’s interspersed into all we do, touch and romance. But, insanely, she’s not interested in using condoms anymore but she’s not on birth control, she’s against abortion. This is insane, but I’m so idiotically accommodating. You’ll think of a solution for next time Jerry, i think. A simple night then morning for the rest of time. And she goes, this thought reverberating within me, should i be doing this, why does she think doing things this way makes any sense.

On Wednesday i saw two of the first friends of my life. Jen and Jesse. I’ve known Jen since i was 3, Jesse moved into our town a few years later. We had a fire in my yard and i made some pizza. Started off relaxed, chatting about our life atm. Jesse had been saving up for a long time, planning to head out west, ideally never to return. He has no plan, he simply wants to pack up and go, draw more. He has a talent for drawing, when we were young we’d make cartoons, and he always did it much better than we. So much more realistic and vivid. A cartoon they took seriously, Simon and scruffy. Jen is working, trying to find her way. She’s in AA, and it makes sense that she is, always the one to get drunk and loud and start breaking things. Getting black out drunk consistently. And after a bit of weed we started reminiscing. Games we played when children. Chinese school, on Jen’s stoop we would have the teacher and students, the teacher would grab a rock, hide it in one hand, and tell the student to pick, if chosen correctly they’d move up a step, if not they’d have to go all the way back down. Why it was called Chinese school, who knows. We played red light green light and mother may i on fern street. Epic snow fights in that random neighbors yard. Murder, we played a ton of murder. Usually the 2 of us and chris in his huge living room. Detective stays in the bathroom. They do not know who the murderer is. The lights go off, everyone hides then the murderer finds someone in the dark, kills then, hides then the dead call out for the detective to decide who is the murderer. A game of deliberation. Board games, the game of life and monopoly, simple games. And lots of wandering around our part of town. We were the kids on this side of town, while most of the others lived on the other side, we had strawberry field, the decks lining the shore, the long parking lot, endless yards and hidden places. We played constantly growing up. Jen’s parents and family, all grew from where we grew up, family all over in close walking distance. My dad did, my mother in a projects by the 6 train. Jesse’s parents by the projects close to where we grew up. Knew each other growing up. He spoke of Jesse’s fathers father. A wild man. He’d tell Jesse’s dad to fight people on the street if they were making too much noise, or else he’d get beat up. How Jesse’s father drove a car that did not have a floor, when they were children they had to lift their legs up the whole time riding in the car. He spoke a bit about Jesse’s fathers time in the army, in Vietnam. The fox holes. Holes hidden with leaves that when stepped on his friends would fall through, into a bed of spikes. He spoke of the noise, a gargling, horrifying sound that his father would impersonate. Jesse spoke more of his work. Of a recent story, how during the snow storm he had to work and at one point while delivering some food a car was stuck behind him, he couldn’t give way. The dude yelled at him telling him he should of went to the side. He replied something like, i had no where to fucking go, get the fuck outta here, in his deep nyc accent. And how the dude decided to chase him, during this snow storm. He was driving his little old Honda while the dude was in an suv, much better to ride in these conditions. It went on like this for 15 or so minutes until, going down a street, he saw a car double parked with a little space that his car could potentially just fit through, he squeezed through, leaving the dude in the dust. It went on like this, one thought after the next, while the fire was burning in front of us. Until it was time to go, we said let’s hang out again soon but who knows if that will happen. Jesse is leaving at the end of march, to wander around the states. A hard working man, who has had time to ruminate on how to make it work the second time around. Jen, always stressed but she always has support in so many directions, a character that people love to listen to. And i, it feels as if I’ll be in Brooklyn for another 10 or so years.

On Friday, we met up to go to a bar with ping pong, pool, shuffleboard, live music. Me, kyle, Janice, Ryan and Jamie. Showed up a bit after the others and, right away, started playing. Game after game. A random woman came over wanting to play. We played and she kept touching me lightly, a boost of confidence, are things this easy? She went and i decided that no, i wouldn’t go for it. Janice showed up all dressed up, heels and a sexy outfit. When telling her to come i told her kyle wanted her ‘sexified’, which she insanely took literally, when it was a joke - i expected more from her, to understand my subtlety. Why i would expect that in another is insane in and of itself. After, we went to a bar. In the west village on a Friday night finding a good spot to sit 5 folks is not simple. But found a spot in an Irish pub. The conversation was here and there, the crew I’m with are barely drinkers, subject to their daily habits, tired when it fits their habits, fun belongs in a set timeframe. But I’m out in the city for the first time in a while, always staying in Brooklyn, so I’m out to have a bit more fun. Two go and it’s me and the other two. He goes on about trivial ideas, penis size and that dumb idea they always bring up, is truth universal? It’s obviously not, but he’s obviously attached to stress-driven words. And he’s touching her a bit, and I’ve told him not to do that before when it’s just the three of us. And I’m bold and impassioned. An idea that’s been bugging me. You seem so much more passive than you were before, i said to her. You were so much more expressive before, so much more free in your expression but now you seem so subdued. And one reason this is so is bc she is being influenced by this man touching her. This man, psychologically damaged and overly masculine. And she’s become dull, boring. And I’m saying this the same way i say just about everything, vigorously but jokingly, with a smile on my face. All about the spectacle, the humor, the meanings and beliefs of others being altered is not an immediate goal, just a seed, a colorful memory. It’s funny around the two of them, the words can simply flow, bc i know him so well, and with her, she can keep up with my insanity - such a rarity in life. But i do not see a problem with their relationship, they’re good for one another, two lonely souls in need. But i wish he was capable of being a more loving and understanding person in the moment, able to live outside of himself in the presence of others. And i wish that she was more able to take control of the relationship’s she is in, because it appears she lets so much happen to her. But nothing is perfect, no decision has a clear truth, all one can hope is that they do not damage one another in too detrimental of a way.

Sunday started as most of my free days. Get up and ready to head to a cafe to do some writing. And then I may do this or that, this day went to Trader Joe’s. And then footy, the pub with the footy group. Some characters had returned, stephano the charming Italian and Greg, the insane and expressissive wannabe poet. The conversation is everywhere, filmmaking and Succession and dating and the Congo and Joseph Conrad. Stephano spoke of this studio in England where realistic plane footage is shot. A plane hung on the wall with a curved LED behind it. This screen has footage not only when the camera faces head on but no matter the angle of the camera, the screen follows suit. So a realistic frame can be done so easily if you have access to this expensive studio. Stefano makes shows for Netflix, director of cinematography. He’s made a show called Don’t Fuck with cats, another called The Ripper. Immersed in the world of film, constantly gone for months at a time filming. He speaks of a scandal in the Vatican, his most recent work, of a girl abducted and never found. It’ll be on Netflix in a few months. Dave is speaking of moving, his rent jumping up 30 percent. With Samir, we spoke of his company, which he is a founder for. How they raised serie a and are trying to doble the size of their company by the end of the year. That he’s in need of a vp of engineering, and that, if a recruiter finds them for you, they charge you a flat fee of 100k. And then he spoke of swimming, something he’s always done, currently at the YMCA near the both of us. And his presence, so calm and composed all of the time, giving me the sense that i should do the same as him - in my journey to find the right form of exercise for myself. And most left, just a few of us left. And Greg, speaking about this then that. Always strangely philosophical. He speaks of the discrepancy between now and the 60/70’s. The creativity and freedom of that period, a time when one could feel it in the air. And how now where are we, he asks? Where is that? We are lost. I speak of the fact that we are gluttons of choice. That perhaps it’s fermenting but he cannot see it, he’s out of touch with the times. But the truth is, he may be right, where is the consensus? And he connects some strange dots, a kind of barbaric self stuck in the old ways with modernity butting it’s head, and he does not know how to find his way. A sort of heart of darkness-like concept. Modernity or civilization has arrived, how will it be dealt with? Pete, next to me, works as an editor of statements written by those that work for the un, the statements of countries constantly thrown into his life. How the Congo, where Conrad gathered his experiences for the heart of darkness, is a country so large, so lacking in homogeneity that it’s as if there are multiple countries in one; how one part can barely collaborate with the other, one of the roots of the mess that this is in. Eventually we all go. And i find myself tipsy walking down 5th avenue, and know not what to do, any ideas seeming not worth pursuing, but see a massage parlor, relax spa, and think that it has been a long time since I’ve had a professional massage. So i go, pay, undress and relax. The massage is great, hard in all the right places, she moves smoothly throughout the body, leaving almost nowhere untouched. She tells me to turn over, and she taps me penis, massage here too? I think for a bit, and the entire time getting the massage had been thinking, should i text this or that woman to see if they’re busy tonight, when touched - and this entire time outside of the massage occasionally she’s leaned her body into this or that part of my body - one cannot help feeling aroused. And I think for a moment, ask - how much? She says it with her hands, 5 fingers and the shape of a zero in the other. 50 isn’t much, i mumble, I’ve never done this before, Idk maybe sure yes, and she goes, comes back. Does slow bits of sensuality, nipple rubbing, massaging the chest and stomach, the groin, and then the penis. I had my eyes open at first and she would glance at me here and there. A cute but likely older woman, probably in her 40s. Thin, fit, and a cute face. But i eventually close my eyes, out of respect. And she continues. Eventually, i finish, she goes, thoroughly cleans it, even the tip, and then massages my upper thighs. The rest of the night, simple, the memory of this reverberating throughout, the first time i paid for any kind of sex.

## some time after

The past dead while moving. The present alive while standing still. Tell me the truth, life. And make sense of this way that life works. I’m just enveloping new lives. Causing myself pain and revelry in the midst. And i know not. Knowing is for those sitting still. Oh life, it only sits still when you do. But I’m lost and i care not. Because life gives to those who create.

## more after (before 3/3/22)

It began exhausted, back from a weekend full of activity, of stress, of little sleep. I took it easy to begin. That Tuesday, joined the ymca, with the desire to make swimming a regular habit. That day, i went swimming for the first time in so long. It’s just a few ways you can reasonably swim. There is freestyle, the one most frequently seen, legs fluttering up and down, one arm after the next reaching out and rotating, the torso in sync - flowing with the rest of the body, face in for a few strokes, out for a breath. The breaststroke, both arms synchronising in this frictionless push forward then a spread to the left and right grabbing the water and pulling you through it, the legs doing a similar movement, the torso with occasional thrusts, and the head in the water during the movement and out during its conclusion. This is what is mainly done. But the intrigue is the feeling of your body when done. Throughout the practice, your heart races, your body is constantly subtly being stretched, you are practicing control of your breath. When done, you feel so free, so alive, such clear thoughts moving out of you.

On Thursday was my birthday, i worked then played soccer. But, i didn’t tell anyone it was my bday. A game then drinks, just a simple day. Returned home and the woman I’d been seeing did the sweetest thing. She left a small cake at my doorstep, my roommate said someone knocked on the door, left it then went away before anyone could open the door. With a card, with kind words, knew the next day i should see her.

So the next day, Friday, i did. We went to this cocktail bar I’ve walked by countless times. Busy within, and there she was all dressed up. Me, plain and simple. The cocktail menu was categorised by how strong the cocktails were - easy, boozy, booziest. The booziest was very boozy. Then back to my place where we smoked weed, so there i was, stoned and cerebral - speaking of god knows what. I shared an anecdote from my young years. A friend of a friend, David, who i can picture so vividly all those years ago driving several of us to a show in city island. Music was his love, what he always put time into. And he, one of the only i know that has become a professional musician, he makes his own music, music for movies and shows. This memory relived because she wanted to listen to Coldplay - which was his favorite band. So we made the bed and put on Coldplay and made love repeatedly until we slept.

On the Saturday i had another date planned with this young woman. We’d been chatting for some time, long messages about Christianity (as she is Christian) and stuff about what things mean. Very personal, all of it, i see no reason any longer to be anything but my best approximation of candid. Pointed words and thoughts and this is my truth, at least at the moment. Eventually she dropped her number, we chatted a bit more but randomly, more focused on funny then these almost paragraphs of text. We planned a meeting, near her, the west village. I decided to walk, around a 5 mile walk from where i live and arrived early so wandered a bit hoping to find a place worth going to. In my mind this is a bit bigger of a date than normal as things built up for weeks before meeting, all sorts of rumination’s built up. And one wonders, does this build up help to create a more vivid memory? One shows up in a place, a planned place, but even more so, a long expected meeting. And, what does one do when thinking of another, even if they never met them, one imagines speaking words to them and perhaps touches and movements conjoined. And this moment of meeting, it’s a culmination of these creations, as if, they were made to be used in this moment. A large part of oneself is to be lived in a short amount of time. And, while this meeting was not so long built up, it nonetheless was more so than many others. And we met, my first impression being a cute but quite volatile human, lots of energy, pretty aggressive, hard. A quick hug and we went off. Soon after, she mentions i sound like some modern comedian, last name ending with a kind of owski. I mentioned to go to this bar i saw in my meanderings, near the water on the west side, a very likely gay bar but it looked quieter and out of the way. It looked to have character. So we went, arrived, after a bit of misgivings - i don’t want to be the only woman in the bar, oh but there’s a few i can see - we went. And outside came the bouncer, a tall and strong and flamboyant man. Oh welcome, all are welcome here. This and that, full of energy, of color, of little bits of fun and funny. She seemed pleased, we went in. Two guinnesses and we went to sit in the only space there was. A group was wrapping up their board game day and we started chatting with some of them. We spoke of board games, of strange things like monkeys killing other monkeys - she literally took out a video, of the size of dolphin penis’s - extremely large, and more. We finished, went to head out, i stopped in the bathroom, a bit uncomfortable, one single long urinal that multiple people can piss into side by side simultaneously, a bit discomfiting being in a gay bar. And when I returned to the door, she was again speaking to the bouncer, they were speaking of whistling which she recently learned, and her belief was confirmed - he has a great whistle. And his look, that perpetual look, when a gay man says something clever - the little smirk and flutter of the eyes, that coquettish look. We went off to do a walk. We went towards the Hudson to walk a bit on the waterway. But the atmosphere, cloudy and wet, and the fact that barely anybody else was on it made a desolate mood which made her uncomfortable - though i crave such places - so we went back to civilization. And kept on walking, we passed this very bourgeois place soon and she stopped to ask a small group how it was, it was good if you like this sort of food - light fare, Mediterranean. And we walked off, where she spoke of an experience of hers sometime before with that exact place. How when they were first opening, her and her friend passed by and started talking to i believe a host or hostess who showed them around. It’s a beautiful place she said but they get very strange clients. She and her friend were told of orgy parties frequently occurring. And she asked, what is the weirdest thing you’ve seen, where she was told that one day, cleaning up the next day one of these parties within one of the bathrooms they found shit all over all the walls, smushed everywhere, spread out everywhere. And a bit more walking, more rapid words, i have to give her that, her mind moves fast. And one more story worth recounting. How she used to volunteer at rikers while in school in nyu. She spoke of the journey there, she spoke of how all was fine there but many were quite racist - why do you think? Probably because no one that looked like me were where they grew up, she is Asian. And i couldn’t help but say that is my reality as well, the only Asians worked in the Chinese restaurants near me, there were barely any elsewhere. Subtle racism, subconscious racism. And eventually, we departed, no hug, just a goodbye. A likely forever goodbye.

On Sunday, we’d been having a quite obscure chat on tinder the last week or so. She had a pic of her with her bike and two coffees, so i went something along the lines of - you even get a coffee for your bike, how romantic. And it went on this way. Me, being odd just kept building it up. The fetishization of bikes by folks in Brooklyn, this obscure little image - folks in Brooklyn loving bikes so much there is a satanic cult of bike lovers that kidnap bikes and do odd stuff in the basement of pizza shops throughout the city, this being the real purpose of the countless pizza shops in the city. Pizza gate but with bikes. And we met this day. At some coffee shop in east williamsburg. And the conversation trickled here and there and eventually we went off to a place to get a some food, this hip Taiwanese spot and went off to a park to eat. The park was full of folks playing football, in a serious way. A ton of folks, excited and exuberant. And we’re there simply taking in the spectacle. She spoke of the common adage of modern young woman, my extended family are anti vaxers, trump supporters, yada ya. I spoke of the normal thing to speak of, the friends in my life. And, we went for one more short walk before i had to go, to mccarren park. And we spoke in a very joking and sarcastic way, of taboos, her frequently dating white men - colonialism, the hopelessness of humanity - we will destroy ourselves, the vanity of brooklynites. We spoke of ways the world can end, that super volcano on Yellowstone that could blow sometime within the next hundred thousand years, gamma ray bursts and solar flares destroying our ozone layer - but, we agree, we ourselves are the most likely candidates. And eventually we arrive and depart.

The following week, i felt quite tired of dating, i scheduled something on Wednesday and Thursday but both i cancelled. I’d decided on being more intentional, more sure before meeting that this was the right kind of meeting, so wanted to find some time to search within myself. On Wednesday, i foolishly forgot to cancel but had not heard from her for days so assumed it was cancelled, but she still showed up and i had to apologise.

On thursday i played football. Invited the normal crew, the crew that’s been annoying me as well, the needy one and his gf. It was one of my better games, i kept scoring goals. And after, as always, drinks. I got stuck sitting near the two of them. We were chatting about plain things, jokes, musings. I always find their interaction so dull. He’s overly protective, always this paternal attitude hovering over him, the one that would be the most satellite of parents - a man living in antiquity. And, they always go to quite fruitless philosophical or religious conversations, which is always the same - he with a self centered expression and she trying to get him to see the more empathetic viewpoint. I have no problem with them being together, they are both so desperate for affection and attention, who else would be willing to give it to them or rather, to him. But i destroyed the harmony, looking at her, i told her you’ve got quite a bit of acne. And she starts to tear, and it’s soon becoming a full blown cry. And the needy one feels the need to assert dominance, looks at me and says silly untruths like you have a small dick. Not sure what can trigger me any longer but that surely is not. She walks away with him, they sit outside, she likely crying and saying petty things about me. I’m sitting with her cousin, we are chatting about them. Gossiping causes me so much pain to engage in but I’m a few drinks in, so i do so. It went something like this: man, it’s really bad between the two of you, it’s really not good - oh it’s been like this for so long, truly doubt there is any way out of it - but i think there may be, why do you think things are this way? - hmm, i think that, more than anything it’s him, i tend to act the same with just about everyone, it’s just my personality, i give everyone shit, he’s just so negative - i do remember seeing some text exchange btw you and him, his gf showed me. And you’re right it was so negative - it’s not just that, this is the norm. Thinking back simply the last week or so, on slack at work, i didn’t want to do a sudden meeting when i had another in less than 10 minutes and he writes something like, it’s fine if you’re a dick to me but i expect you to be professional. Another time where he asked how a date went, i said fine but probably won’t see her again whereas he goes, is it you or her that decided not to see each other again. It’s just he jumps so negatively so fast, as if he’s looking for ways to reinforce his own self righteousness - that is kinda shitty, i need to sit him down and talk about this stuff - ya i am concerned about her, bc i do worry about him changing her for the worse, damaging her in some way. And then they are back, and i apologise and she says it’s a me problem, not a you problem. But he sits next to me, he looks me dead on and says: if you ever do this again I’m gonna break your neck, I’m gonna put you in the hospital. I find this amazing, a reinforcement of all I’ve been thinking and saying so it’s not something unexpected, simply more proof of his partial insanity, his volatility. And soon after, they go. And it’s me and sam again. You saw that? - that is so toxic, i really need to talk to him about this, the thing is, if you look at him, he has next to no one, you can count the amount of good friends he has on one hand. I always, if i hear from him, make a point to respond, because of how little he has. And she’s like that too, she knows next to no one in this city. Two very lonely people kinda in need of one another. But i am concerned, I’ll try and make a point to talk about this with him at church, it really is toxic behaviour - ok let’s chat with the rest of the folks, enough of this. And I’m simply glad that he’s still here because he usually leaves early and I feel like slowly we’ve been becoming closer, and this is one of the first times we’ve had a truly serious discussion. And he, is a quite serious man, a natural intermediator, so very easily can he bring about a stoic and neutral demeanour, using the right words each step of the way. We sit, drink a bit more, go.

On Friday i saw her once again. She was out with friends but finished round 8, she came over and we made a fire. Me, her and my roommate. The chat meandered. He spoke quite a bit, he spoke of being a chief at his ancestral grounds, being Native American. How titles are inherited matrimonially. How this was his mothers mother mother… on and on’s land. He spoke of how they would start the ceremonies when night hit and dance around the fire until the sun came back up. Of cartons of cigarettes being what one gives to other tribal leaders. How all tribal leaders have a box full of smokes, how they smoke cigarettes all the time, the pipe has gone out of fashion. Politics came up, she used to work in politics, in dc, for a think tank, writing speeches and the like. She read some quote about Italians being so very good at the arts but not so much as politicians. With some odd reason being that they see art as an ideal, something that can be perfected whereas the nitty gritty of politics, they inherently distrust it as an institution. And we moved onto reading, me reading this and that which i wrote to them, and positive reinforcement. We finished the wood, went inside. She spoke of leaving; before any sort of love making which was fine but not sincere. We sat and spoke and eventually one thing led to the next, and it was good. She alleviated my concerns of the most dreaded reality, pregnancy, as she started taking the pill, she said only for you. And i felt odd about this, but she is against condoms, so i felt this to be reasonable, i simply pray that in her so doing so it does not cause her too much harm. We finished, she had this look of sadness and concern, it seemed so that she spoke of us to friends and said she would not do this but she did it and this saddened her. I knew not what to do, but try to summon the right words and touches. She soon went, it was almost 3 am.

Saturday was with the older group of friends. All the way in jersey, to play some poker. Arrived and it was a small surprise bday party for me. A quite unexcited surprise, just some balloons and a half hearted happy bday. Thankfully there was a bottle of whiskey. So we played after the rest came, a simple game. Heady and a bit tired as appears to be the default mentality of several of them. Why is it that people allow their selves to be tired? It’s a decision, you feel tired yes, but you can remember that feeling over and over again, or ignore it and enjoy the moment you are living. You can be tired on your own or others time. They gave me a few gifts… skis which annoyed me to receive - why give one such a large and bulky gift, I simply dreaded having to take it home and wondered if i will ever use them - and a nice little gift, metal sticks for marshmallows or grilling. A sweet card, and all I wondered was how do i feel for these people? One drives me nuts, another is attached to this one so reinforces his behavior, two that are also more attached to him than me, and the last two, young and enjoying life, neutral. The night goes on, the lovers that drive me nuts go. And we speak about him, about ways he’s behaved and they seem, at least a bit, on the same page as me. It’s unhealthy, they know, they’re trying to get him to understand this. This is said with weariness, with unsaid thoughts rumbling behind. But it’s late and we go. Just me and two young ones. She begins speaking of their relationship, about how it took him so long to call her his girlfriend. I’m supposed to give advice and I say my experience, i am on her side. I say, I’ve made the decision at the beginning always and never, if not naming it near the beginning, named it later. You do not decide on this, you know it from the beginning. And i see peevishness in his eyes, he says things like i needed to know, i needed to think a lot about it, i want to marry someone. And, in his eyes, i sense the fact that this is simply a decision he’s made, words he has decided to say but he doesn’t truly feel them. And, i want to build on this, but he’s a handsome man and his words sound sincere so she swoons, she is lost in him. I retreat into my thoughts and prayers. I hope she sees what their relationship boils down to sooner than later, or rather, i hope they see now - i mean, they must in one way or another. But the decisions they make, i pray it brings them comfort.

The next day, hungover, i awake, needing to see a woman in crown heights. A woman with two kittens from iran. We meet at such a cute cafe. All seats are outside, spattered around the sidewalk, pedestrians strolling through the middle. Crown heights main thoroughfare is a small two way road, with white tight sidewalks, all feels so connected, so centralised. And the pedestrians, so hip and young, they look so fun. The stores are the same, such care is put into creating a vibe. And the cafe is as so. It’s a tiny cafe, just 4 or so seats built into the wall. But there’s a one step stoop going in with a couple tables, seemingly attached to the cafe. Sitting there, a man painting, attired as if he’d been transported from 18th century Paris. That painters hat, the beard, the clothe. And we sit, me and her, and mainly speak of her kittens. Both months old, she’s attached to them so much. And we spoke of this and that. She told of a story, a man from a dating app, he invited her to a local art show in bushwick. In a small apartment, she mentioned seeing the man and said she’d been catfished, she ran out with her friend before meeting him. We didn’t say much more, i walked with her for a bit then departed.

Date on wed with a woman I’d been chatting with for some time. Late 20s, an editor for big publications that write about gossip - USA today and the like. She works with advertising writing. Quite dissatisfied with the work but money speaks. She was nice to look at. Nice to speak to, we had a few good laughs. She spoke of this school she went to, the Friends Seminary in the union square/east village area. A Quaker school, though it appears the denomination has renamed itself to be called The Religious Society of Friends, hence having their schools named Friends Seminary’s. She spoke of the defining feature of these schools being their weekly service, called meeting for worship. A service very different from a normal religious service. There is no minister. Rather, everyone sits together in silence. And, when one decides to speak, it’s because they feel a kind of divine reason to do so. And, after one speaks several minutes must follow in silence before anyone else can speak. And when that person speaks it is not in answer or response to what the other said. That is all which happens, silence, one speaks, silence, another speaks, until the hour passes. And outside of this, we spoke of sports, of activities, of friendships. And, it was a fine time, but i never reached out to her again. It made me wonder then after, that i am getting closer to what i am in search of - moving in the right direction, but there is still a ways to go.

A few days later was a friends show, at this hip spot in Bowery. I showed up a bit early and met up with a friend, an older man of such strangeness. One very self conscious mannerism after the next, one odd phrase after the next. And he, strangely enough in modern times is a lover of Russia, supportive of the annexation of Ukraine. But we did not speak of this. We spoke of dating, he mentioned his ex wife, a professional artist and how this has taught him to be able to live in the confusion, the inconsolability of life. And sausages and Germany. He recited German poetry out of nowhere. And how much gets lost in translation. We were in a beer garden, full of people I’d tend to avoid, finance looking and faces and clothes without allure, without character. We left to go to the place with the show, called Pianos. And outside, in this part of town, one could not help but notice the beauties in this area, such attractive people constantly passing by - stylish and well shaped with picturesque faces. I saw strange relationships, old men with beautiful deafened faces. We soon arrived, were only let in as we said our friend was playing, and within the first room - so hip, young men and women of color everywhere wearing their stylish outfits, ready for a night of debauchery. I went downstairs to use the restroom and was transported back to life in the bronx. A few kids i could see born and raised in the bronx waiting with me in this tight corridor. And, the ease of words, the way of speaking where conversations are not face to face but rather out loud for all to hear - one speaks as if on a stage or in a scene. A long wait and jokes came out of me, the white stuff or some sweet loving i say then laughter and they acquiesce. And one decides to go to the doors, there are three - two across from one another and one in front, and he stands in the middle and pushes two doors at once, both open. The wait is over. Upstairs and into the back room where the show had begun. The musician friend i came to see was right there and he says, oh it’s just you - i only invited you bc i thought you’d bring one of your many children - with a smirk and smack of the back. Moments later he was on stage, the drummer, playing in a band very Midwest like. Communal, white, odd, sensitive. And i swayed, payed attention. There was so much chitchat around but when there is a band playing i need to look, i need to try to understand. Right in front of me such a strange scene. Two women and a man. One woman so drunk she kept screeching out in jubilation. And the other woman with her ass attached to the man, the man never uttering a word, constantly stoic. I hear her say, i want his dick in me as an argument for i know not what. The show goes on, the singer a short bearded man, the main guitarist a tall intense woman, a wily and nerdy looking one playing a variety of instruments, and my friend, a stocky English ginger playing the drums. The songs go on, the singer plays a few mainly solo songs which he prefaces with saying, fuck there’s a lot of words in this song, before diving in and performing quite well. The show ends with a cover of a raucous ballad. The wily nerdy one comes off stage and the drunk woman in front of me kisses him before being shuttered away by her friend.

## 3/3/22???

Ski trip to Vermont with the close group
Between he and i a bit of animosity had been building up. It’s been through my choosing, my default of breaking a taboo when i see it. The taboo being poking at his sensitive soul. Not letting it reside in its foolishness, trying to break it, make it something worthy of respect. Oh, but i step too far, of course, but built up words cannot help but become written words by those that write. So a sense was there that, perhaps, this trip will be a mess, arguments and fights and stress for all.

We leave on a Thursday night, to begin our 5 hour ride. Me and he and his gf and another friends wife. Me and he sit in the back, the wife drives while the other rides shotgun. We have a box, quite wall-like btw us. And we chat and my jokes are the same, smacking the sensitivity while his jokes, they are less so smacking the deeply psychological, rather, they hold negativity. They aim to morph the narrative, turn half truths into realities in others minds, bring the world against me. And he continually succeeds in this during the weekend, for those there are attached to him, more so than me, susceptible to being told what to think. But perhaps i get by without remorse as i see my behaviour as showing him foolish ways he behaves. His lack of remorse, possibly as he has support, reinforcement and carefully organised reasons. Back to the car, things passed in a normal fashion most of the way until he brought up religion. Oh Buddhists believe in reincarnation, how does that make sense in any way? And i have no patience to speak of religious matters with him, his mind is too closed, too focused on particulars - he cannot see outside of himself, perhaps he literally cannot picture anything, it’s all words within. But i left the conversation, it’s him and his gf. Ideas boring and senseless to me, the divinity of Jesus, historical evidence of this untruth. Some conception of heaven and hell. And she says what i would say, the empathetic reality, perhaps this conception has a counterpart in Buddhism, perhaps that is what reincarnation is, a metaphor for heaven and hell. And the other religions have similar structures. And arguments. And to me the argument is over but in Christianity there is no argument for the other side because the other side didn’t have some dude named Jesus that did miraculous things back in the 1st century. God inseminated a woman, made a magician that can break physical laws in tiny ways, and then he can die for a day, get reborn, then vanish somewhere. Where is that somewhere? Idk, no one ever mentions it. I’m just happy someone could entertain him because i have no more patience to talk of these topics with him. Eventually, we arrive.

The next day, a Friday. The three of us, but not the gf. But it had begun to snow and we had over an hour to get to the ski resort. We tried to drive, failed after a few blocks, came back. The car could not handle the freshly carpeted roads. So, we were back in the little house in North Adams, Massachusetts. A quaint home. People live here, it’s not just an Airbnb. Tibetan flags hanging outside. Buddhas in and out the house. The food in the kitchen, the decor, the slogans littered here and there created a new age atmosphere. Upstairs, a bidet toilet, and on both, squatty potties. Once you come in, a massage chair. We settled in, disappointed about not skiing but the day still had to be lived. The couple were mainly in their own world, occasionally visiting reality. He speaks, she reinforces over and over. I hear, and rarely feel sentiment. Laptop conversation, this way people traverse here and there on the internet, YouTube videos and memes and conversation surrounding this. It’s all so electric, so exhausting to communicate in such a way. And I wonder why he retreats for constant naps. To recharge and come back with insane energy repeatedly. We do a puzzle, mainly i and the wife. A puzzle made out of real wood, cut in all sorts of odd shapes - faces and rabbits and a protractor and so much more. We spend hours doing it, and it’s painful at times because the sides are not always clear, you cannot do the sides first as the inside comes to the side, attaches to the side, completes it. Eventually we finish, get groceries. He cooks a soup, 7/10 perhaps. We play dungeons and dragons. First time in my life. It’s a simple game in actuality. Someone has a storyline with a bunch of options and the other players simply chooses an option. But in a conversational way, you’re role playing as a character, the rules and options are not explicitly spoken of. I, for whatever reason, decide to be Eleanor, a trans woman dwarf. He is a dragon-human thing, named Stephen Hawkins but the character is just him. The gf, a male character, but still her personality exudes, a certain timidity, she’s become so timid. It goes on and on, random expression, me being flamboyant and playful, he explanatory and occasionally funny, her timid, and the wife full of revelry because this is her game, she’s so happy we’re playing. A long night, and someone has to clean up so i take it upon myself. Inadvertently throw away the rice, which was in and of itself poorly done and sloppy, creating a halestorm needed to handle in the future. Eventually, the rest arrive, the cunning one and the chill couple. Me and the chill ones stay up a bit later than the rest, speaking of relationships, of the woman i should not be seeing but am seeing, the fact that he is actually calling her his gf now. But eventually, the night ends and we go to sleep.

The next day is a ski day. The storm has passed, the roads are paved. I awake, the first up though one of the last to bed. Me and my puzzle buddy make breakfast for the rest. Pancakes, toast, eggs and bacon. Coffee. The others awake an hour or two after and we eat, head out. It’s the same road i went down a few weeks back, during a storm, with Billy. Vermont in the winter, snow storms and always in cars not made for the conditions. But today was fine, only images of the past reimagined. We get to the mountain in the afternoon, mount snow. Eventually we’re on the slopes. Quite a few with us are very amateur. So it’s slow going, trepidation and fear, while i zip down, go through the trees like it’s nothing. We eventually get to the side of the mountain i love. No structures here but two old lifts. The view going up the lift, when the clouds depart, is breathtaking. A winding river into a large lake, green pine forests abound, blanketed in snow. And there are so many fewer folks here, especially amateurs. People acclimated to being in the slopes, contributing more fun and efficiency to the experience. But only one run goes back down that is not a black diamond. So we wander round the mountain instead. I lose them at one point when i do a path intimidating to a few. The day passes, i end by walking with the wife. She snowboards and the last path to the car was a bunny hill, i rode down it sitting on the board, snow splaying all over my face. And we get to the car, just the two of us. Her car, with over 300k miles, she speaks of being soon done with it, they plan to get a new car soon. We continue on in this vein, practical thoughts until the rest arrive and we head back to the house. It’s our last night in it, so i and a few others want to enjoy it. As i threw away the rice the day a strange plan was conspired where he convinced his gf to tell me i need to make the rice for the leftover soup, i simply said no to her request, with no desire to explain myself regarding, to me, a fundamentally trivial matter. I just wanted to make pizza, which was what i planned to do for dinner. The first thing to do is proof the yeast, which entails putting it with water around 105 degrees and waiting for it to activate. Either the water was too hot or too cold or was too old so the yeast did not activate, it did not proof. And i had no more yeast, but needed to toss what i had and start fresh. At this time the couple were upstairs focusing on each other, some were napping in the living room, no one was created an atmosphere. The atmosphere was sleep, and i was exhausted but why let that prevent one from fully living? I will make pizza and create fun. It was a kitchen used frequently so i searched and found more yeast, reproofed it and all was ready in 10 minutes, a weight off my chest. And the fun ones were with me, i let the woman do the dough. The yeast water with some flour and salt, extremely simple. Eventually we are good, the dough is rising, so onto the next thing. So wine and bringing some life into the house. No more sleep. Back to the pizza, assembling it, cooking it. We set the table for a family dinner. Two of the males are children when they’re sleepy, they had to be pushed to awake and contribute positively to the atmosphere. One even had to be convinced to sit at the table, so obviously because this was of my making, the pizza, the setting of the table. His toxic attitude. And they’re Christian’s, so someone ought to say grace. Janice, Lou Lou, Brian, one of you please. I want them to learn to be confident, to live uncomfortably, to learn to express theirselves fully. But of course he is in need to assert himself once again, and he says it, like a worn out father that has never learned to cultivate freedom in others expression. Setting himself roles that he executes so lacking in originality. Life goes on, another reason for consternation. We clean up and move to poker, the fun ones wanted to play. Not knowing what to use, we used puzzle pieces, the same puzzle with all the odd shapes. Now, the pieces were such an assortment of shape as has been mentioned, anormal puzzle shapes and shapes that look like little people, ships, walls, the single rabbit, faces, swords, so many subtle shapes. One can consider pieces as so, in a purely sentimental sense, of more or less value. So to begin the game this idea hit me and it was a good laugh for the starting bit but, obviously, too difficult to keep up the whole game. But more creativity was available, one could build a kind of scene, which of course i did. Ships coming towards a structure with beams and entrances and soldiers standing guard, in the back an image of regality, one on a throne, the back an oval, the puzzle man sitting, looking out to the world. And at this time, some of us had smoked a joint, one man high for the first time in his life, the rest of us just chilling, having fun. And the night went on, drinking and snacking, enjoying life. All those but i and the fun ones departing early on. And it’s just us, finishing the game, then some quiet conversation and off to sleep.

We all awake lazily and late the next day. It was his gfs day to shine. She set up breakfast and made coffee. All up, all fed, all packed, and we departed the house. The wife and her husband left separately. So the other 5 of us in the small car, driving up to okemo mountain. She is driving. We played games, 20 questions, i spy. Simple conversation. We arrive, get our gear and begin our day. I’ve been here before, I’ve been to all the lifts, there is one side that i love. The side separate, only accesible by going down to it. Just the lift and slopes and wilderness. I’m reminded of a story from a friend recently of this exact part of the mountain. He and a couple others were feeling adventurous on this side of the mountain, decided to go under the rope, only ones on the slope - and then they got down, only to realise the lift had stopped running, they were stuck. The bobsled came, took them up one by one. So we ended up there ourselves, the lift was running. The scene around the lift is picturesque. The trees around you creating an enclave around the base of the lift and the slope above you, skiers and boarders coming down from this slope or that, joining the space and the space. People waiting on all sides to get on the lift. And the lift, smooth and continuous, no hiccups. An older lift but one of quality, with distinct character. And going up this lift, you go above frequently used slopes, and partly above dense tree trails where one can see others leisurely traversing, barely anyone you see an amateur, many with silky and playful movements. Most of the tree trails were closed so i needed backup movements to practice. I constantly searched for little side paths connected to the slope, doing all that seemed worth pursuing. Almost always ahead of the others, someone must be the spectacle. Little jumps and quick turns. And when none of that, i practiced quick hip movements, my skis slightly to the left than the right, a smooth dance down the slope. And the end of the day, back at the base, we sit by the fire for a bit before heading out. For dinner, we stop at a barcade place with food. After eating, i had to play some games. The hunting game and then Tetris. And Tetris took so much of our money, it hooks you, starts off easy but gradually gets more difficult - faster moving pieces, randomly dropped pieces - and when you lose, do you want to continue? That’s the hook, you’re continuing at a difficulty that makes you lose the game faster, so one coin after the next, down the hole. We played that game - legendary in arcade world - those wooden balls, rolled up the ramp and into the holes with variable points - 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 100 - each a bit more difficult to get into. But the noise of it, so satisfying, analogous to the sound of bowling. And we head out. We, extremely annoyingly, have to return to the house we left because he has left his bag at the air bnb, with his work laptop within it. But a premonition while at the arcade, snow but not light, a heavy snowstorm is happening outside, we think to wait for it to pass before we go. And then we go, we have, at least, a 6 hour drive back and darkness is beginning to hit. And, our car, an old little Honda with over 300k miles on it. Thoughtlessly, we take a road quite remote. And soon the storm has returned and it’s not even remotely calm, we are not remotely safe. We’re near the heart of it, and can barely see further than a few metres in front of us. The gf driving. And all I’m doing is keeping my eyes open, random little comments. He is being very tender but also is prone to saying, i can drive if you want over and over connoting he can handle it better, which I object. She is concentrating as best as she can. If a better equipped car is directly in front we try to follow, otherwise we stay on the road but the road is caked with snow, covered all around, no where to go but continue. And we do, extremely slow. At one point the traction is lost, the car swerve’s and one can feel her heart palpitating. All our hearts do. And soon after, amazingly, we are back in some form of civilization, no more dark country roads barely traversed but roads not full of snow and bright lights in all direction. I think and say, this is a temporary refuge, we’ll be going back into the quiet back roads likely full of snow but it looks like it may dissipate after an hour or so - why not stop here for an hour or so? But she’s waiting for his opinion and his opinion is to ignore this reasoning so she says nothing. We continue onward, going through the same hell once more. Our hearts on edge the entire time, until we once again hit civilisation. This being the town we began the day in, where he left his bag. And relief but of course he can’t help saying something like, i was right and you were wrong about stopping. And to me this is simply petty, i say, what? Should i have hoped that we were caused harm for the sake of being right? I’m just annoyed that you would think to say something like this. You should admit when you are wrong he says something of the vein. And all i say is i hope you can learn to change these sorts of behaviours. But we go on and arrive back at the house, the place we returned to only because of him. He goes, maybe it’s a good thing that i forgot the bag as we are safe and all i say is we probably would not have gone down those hellish roads if you did not forget your bag. But now we are trying to get the bag but the door is locked, someone locked the bottom keyhole, we only could unlock the number lock. So, we had to do this and that to get in, and the this that worked was climbing through a window. And neighbors could see us do this if they were paying attention so a vague fear of the police arriving was on our mind. But we still smoked a cigarette, to calm the nerves then head back the rest of the way. Mainly quiet but occasional conversation. Probably the most interesting being between the two above, him with his hand on her thigh the whole way - attached to her. While she asks of his past and he responds quietly, distractedly, disconnectedly. Eventually, we found our way to jersey city. And she’s exhausted, zombie like. They stay at the house and me and the fun ones head back to Brooklyn.

## after (march ski trip)

In the midst of this, there has been plans set for another trip to Vermont. A house was rented that can fit up to 30 people. And a core crew was put into place, soccer folks being the primary organizers. And i invited a couple, the couple so prominently on my mind. We were to drive up together. The day of, i picked up the car, picked them up and we parked on a block in Brooklyn to do a caravan. 3 cars in procession, heading up to mount okemo in Vermont. I stopped in jay’s house to use the restroom. Meeting their pup and kitten. An adorable little white kitten. And cata’s parents were there. Quite elegant people. Well dressed with faces fine, manners refined. Such a juxtaposition to jay’s, well his mother and sister, raunchy working class Americans. And soon the trip begins. Us in the middle, the van full of bros in front, Jay and his family in back. In the car, quite random conversation, anecdotes and memories and nothing particularly personal. But as frequently appears to be the case, a kind of moodiness btw me and he. She in the front and he in the back, sitting quite oddly. Instead of sitting back, he sits upright, leaning forward, always this need to impose his physical presence. The caravan stops at Burger King. The nationwide question, how does the impossible whopper compare to the regular. Not much of a difference is the consensus, they taste the same, the impossible seemingly better. And this odd scene, he goes - I’ll race you to the liquor store. And he leaves, runs full speed to the store a ways away on the other side of the parking lot. And i walk to the car, drive slowly there, confused. It’s a strange part of this man’s character, his odd and senseless interpretation of what is fun. He views it as being playful, almost all adults would view it as a kind of insanity. Suppose it’s nice to run sometimes. Some liquor is bought and we continue inwards. The conversation takes a slight turn. She reads what I’ve written. I speak of what i perceive i am doing. Gathering emotions, images, scenes, pictures - and one day I’d like to take a sabbatical and organize it, create a story out of it. Its so easy to look at what I’m doing, judge it, build assumptions. And one never knows if what they are doing is right, but it doesn’t take too much thought to realise that one of the quickest ways to find out if it is right is to tell everyone you can. Others thoughts of you become your own thoughts, one may say. And we arrived eventually. A huge house, 3 stories, a large living room, a pool table, a massive hot tub, a big stream passing by, countless rooms. Me and the two i drove with decided to head into the hot tub. Such peace within. The stream passing by sounded like a constant rain shower. The trees overlooking us, covering us. We spoke of this and that but what was most memorable was him crying. It was because we spoke of death and he remembered a friend who died quite recently. She committed suicide by jumping in front of a subway car. And there he was tearing and she turned into something so tender. The image of the two of them in front of me. He, whimpering while she cradled him with the most tender of looks. Something so sensitive, so confusing, so strange to see. And I’m mainly quiet, taking it in, imprinting it in my memory. Trying to understand this way one can be, to well up with so much emotion for the memory of one. I tried to think of those I’ve known who’ve died, remember our dearest experiences but the most i can do is slightly quiver. And i say this, what is wrong with me, why can i never cry? And it engrossed me, for weeks, going on dates and serendipitously a woman asking me the last time i cried, google searches not in my favour, and all i have settled into thinking is that there is a part of me lacking. I just don’t know if i will ever know what it is. We go out, and join the hang out in the living room -lazy and tranquil. The night goes and ends.

The next day, only two of us were to ski. Strange weather. Rainy and terribly cold. Was solely me and Dave, English Dave. A strange beginning, the base we would usually go up from is closed so we take a bus to the main base. And begin our day on the slopes. The resort is quite depressing to see, where is the snow? The trees are not skiable, the little fun paths on the side of trails are not. David is as amiable as one can be, his accent, the way he tells a story, so engaging. But conversation with me tends to be quiet, personal. He asks me questions first, of dating, of my friends but i move the questions towards him. He is working in book publishing. Been doing it for years, it’s what brought him to the city, to manage a new office opening up. He’s soon to start a new part time job teaching a class about this at nyu for students getting their masters. In the midst of this the lifts we go up are covered with ice, an inch thick. And while going up, stuck on these frozen chairlifts, we are breaking it off, piece by piece. The seat, the back, the bars you pull down to keep from falling out. An ordeal, but we continue on, ending the day 3 or so hours later. We go back to the house. After showering, I’m back with the group. I brought a weed brownie to the trip that my roommate made. And a couple of the house mates were about to have a bit. I told them to just have a little like my roommate recommended and did the same myself, a little chunk of the brownie. And we wait. A feeling is building up. Within an hour i realise I’m incredibly high. The others that took the brownie are watching the avengers. I considered doing the same even though it was not what i would ideally do - but there was no space for me. So, i thought to wander for a bit, find a place worth being. I went to the top floor where no one was, where the feeling was right. My body was feeling it so much, i felt exhaustion in my bones from little sleep the day before and skiing this day. I tried to do something normal, there was a wii which i tried to get working, but soon realised the wires needed were not there. So i just laid on the couch, rested while realizing that i was gradually becoming more and more high. Not in a subtle way but overwhelmingly. I looked at myself, just stared at the feelings running through me. I felt every sensation within my body but multiplied. My pains became heart wrenching, my heart beat so violently, my body was involuntarily shaking. I felt so extreme, so vivid that i considered this time in my life to be monumental. I felt around my body, looking for feelings that i always feel, pains that never leave me. My fingers, early in my career as a cook i twice cut my skin so deeply that i had to get stitches. An x on my left thumb and a slice down my right ring finger, through the nerve. The ring finger pain enveloped me. I read about this finger, this nerve on Wikipedia. And realised i never tried to find out, can i heal the nerve, can i heal this injury from so many years ago? The pain never dissipates, that feeling one gets when one’s arm or leg falls asleep, spiky and numb, never leaves. It’s felt most when touched, the area feels raw and weak, much less useful than it could be. My left thumb, rather, feels dense, lacking in flexibility, constantly reposed in an unnatural way. When bent or used i feel a buzzing feeling in the finger and my mind. It can never be healed i quickly found, surgery is impossible after all these years, the nerve cannot be reattached in my ring finger, the thumb - what can be done? Recut so it reposes in a more natural way? And looking this up, living in the sensations of these two fingers, my heart had never stopped in it’s euphoria, just as it is now thinking of this and putting myself in the feelings that never leave these injuries, these lifelong stresses. Ones mind tends to learn to repress the thoughts of its bodily pains, a manic sensation arises when they are brought to the forefront. I needed to move, to realign my being. There was a balcony nearby, i went to it. It had such symmetry, the house had 3 stories but the part of it going towards the yard - which had several baths and bedrooms - went out in front of the balcony with the center of this roof in perfect symmetry with the center of the balcony. And directly beyond, the wide stream and big trees. Amazingly, there were hawks flying from tree to tree. I stood there in wonder, and started to consider this scene, comparing it with the nature and, more so than that, the wildlife. I never see anything remotely like this back in Brooklyn. And one of my driving companions comes out into the balcony, i point out the hawks and he decides for whatever reason to lie to me as a joke. No, I do not see any hawks, i do see a trash bag though, and I’m too weary and frustrated to engage in this so i simply wait for him to leave. I go back in and soon others are arriving into the house. Cata and cian and the dog, Dante. My nerves are in anticipation of new guests in this room i am haunting. They come up, simple hellos and me trying to look a semblance of sane. I’ll be back to normal in hopefully a few hours i say. Others come soon after, Andy and April, who i barely know, with a quite nervous dog. We’ve all been there they say. They go down and back to my loneliness, haunting this place, an intimidating ghost doing god knows what. I go back to the phone, deciding to explore more deeply into my behaviours, myself. I think of the fact of all these odd little objects l own, that my roommate owns. That we hoard. What is hoarding? It’s an animal trait observed in many animal species Wikipedia says. An animal that is an infamous hoarder, a hamster. And i read that the word that means to hoard in German, polish, Hebrew, Swedish, Dutch - is derived from the word for a hamster in the language. And my mind has that feeling, of intense revelation, when the mind feels to suddenly be lit up in every single part of it, it buzzes. And it’s because, for whatever reason you think that you have discovered something so important and meaningful, you feel as if you will never be the same. A knowledge that will forever be a part of you. And the thought was this: if our language, if words created in our language are often derived from the study of animals, as if we better learn of who we are through this study, then this must still be happening right now in the development of our language. Language, the words constantly within us, our very conception of our selves. So i think of the animals around me, around my life while living in Brooklyn. I think again of what is in front of me, this scene, of hawks flying from tree to tree directly in front of me. Such a strange form of knowledge must be given to people that often witness this. And what do i have in nyc? Oh the rare raccoon or hawk, the sparrows and occasional blue jays or cardinals, pigeons, domestic cats and dogs, but then the thought of the most spoken of wild animal - rats. And another revelation, they’re everywhere in the city, millions upon millions of them - are they the animals people in this city learn the most from, are they what shapes this city and make it what it is? I think of what they do, hiding in crevices, how different the streets would look without them - the extra food scraps littered everywhere, if they did not constantly clean them up - the way we interact with them, this perpetual guerrilla warfare, monsters living everywhere around us. There are cases in nyc where rats will eat parts of babies left unattended, a rare occurrence, yes, but to imagine that such a thing is a possibility - it’s horrifying. I return to Wikipedia, i read about them, they’re a part of the family of rodents. The distinguishing feature of a rodent is that they have a pair ‘of continuously growing, razor-sharp, open-rooted incisors’. These teeth grow continuously throughout their lives and they must constantly work to break them down by chewing, tearing, ripping at this and that or else the teeth will not only grow out of their mouth but also up into their scull, eventually piercing their brain, killing them. All of my rabid thoughts and reading has made me forget how my body feels, so i go back into it. My heart is once again beating so rapidly, my mind is so euphoric, my bodily pains are so apparent. My back hurts and i wonder, everything right now is so very intense and will be memorable, why not learn better how to live physically, another revelation. So i read of posture, the key is aligned joints and a neutral spine. I read that there is a significantly higher mortality rates for those who regularly sit for prolonged periods. Terrifying to read, another revelation, i must find a way to stop being a programmer or sit less when working. This goes on, i live in my damaged fingers once again and wonder this time of pain, of chronic pain. And begin reading of this, finding my way to a page about leprosy. Of all things, leprosy, how it is a bacterial infection, how there were over 5 million cases in the 80s, down to around 200k now, how 95% of people who contract it do not develop the disease, there are still leper colonies, that it can take up to 20 years after exposure for symptoms to develop. This disease so mystical, so much a part of our cultural heritage, existent for so long, thought to solely exist in antiquity - brought to light. And I’m reading this because of another revelation - what am i doing with my life? Doing drugs, drinking, enjoying life selfishly, what am i doing for the world? How am i contributing to making things better? And these thoughts so sobering and my euphoria and beating heart, sobering. Heading back to reality, almost ready to rejoin society. So i go down, and they’ve been talking about me but here i am, a spectre, back as a part of society. And the first thing that happens, the nervous dog comes up to me, barks viciously at me, nips me softly. I’m shattered, the dog won’t like me the rest of the trip, it’ll be like walking on eggshells with her for then on. I wondered if this would have been different if my energy was secure, not wild and stoned. I hang with the group, socialise, try to explain myself at least a bit. Speak of my odd insights, the rats shape our city, leprosy is still prevalent, rodent incisors, the hawks, my injured fingers - but most of all, it’s been years since i was so stoned. The night went on, one other that took brownie has been asleep for hours, the other took a nap and returned. I’m just blending in, trying to save some face, trying to be normal but for the rest of the night i was stoned. Any food or drink just slightly changed that. Before bed another one of us took some brownie. Finally, to bed.

For possible future use:
Am i a hoarder, i wondered. So off to Wikipedia. I see that this is a behaviour of a variety of animal species. Most specifically, the hamster, linguistically. In German, Swiss, Hebrew, polish - to hoard is derived from their word for a hamster. And i wondered, if our very definitions of our own behaviours is created through studying animals, of which is, at least in the respect of the word hamster, true. Then, does this mean that the animals which are near us, living around us, also shape our very behaviours. As if, fundamental ways in which we behave is influenced by the wildlife around us. I think of what wildlife there is in my city. Birds, one may say dogs and cats, raccoons, but the one that is the most successful, the one that appears to shape our city more than any other, are rats. I realise, i know so little of rats.

The next day was the big ski day, a bunch of us were going. The morning was pleasant, quiet and powdery. We ended up on the south face, the side least used, soon after they opened the single lift there. And it was so good, fresh and untouched snow. And eventually most of us ended our day, stopping at the nearby restaurant, simple fried food and nachos and fiddlehead ipas. A man playing pop music on his guitar with this proud smirk so characteristic of musicians. A few of us went back out. We spoke of how ski mountains often become mountain bike trails when the snow is melted, this and that. We skied for a bit longer but the mountain had turned into slush. Continually running into puddles of slush. We soon left. A dip in the hot tub then it was time to make pizza. I was in charge of the dough and much of the preparation of the toppings. Almost 20 people would be eating tonight. A bit brain dead so all I wanted to do was work on the dough but a friend kept on putting himself in my way with suggestions and thoughts and distractions and eventually one of us had to tell him to stop being a ‘dickhead’, he cleaned up - picked up the bottles and the like, made himself useful. I felt like a chef, directing anyone that wanted to help. We had such an assortment of toppings: artichokes, arugula, basil, olives, dried meats, chicken, cheeses, pecorinos, peppers, onions, pesto, the big pot of pizza sauce David was making. The dough rose, and it was time to start the pizza assembly. All the toppings spread out on the kitchen island and a group of folks hovering around it. I asked who’d like to make the pizza and thankfully folks were excited to do it. I spread the dough on a pan, passed it on. One, two, three… pizzas. Out of the oven and the next until it felt to be enough. A dozen or so pizzas. Me, the entire time with this chef like demeanour, concentrating on doing the best I could. And, terrifyingly people began to cheer for me with claps and yells and squeals. I try to not look embarrassed as all i think is that i could have done better, i hoped the dough was genuinely good. I felt like an imposter. Eventually i sat, wined and ate the pizza which was actually quite good. At some point, Andy takes out a guitar and plays a song, singing loudly with his raspy voice. A natural showman, loud and rambunctious, an infectious personality, such energy. After, i thought to try and move the party upstairs, to play some pool so a few of us went up, then a few more and a few more until the lot of us were crowded in this tight room with the pool table. Someone puts the tv on, sports. Which drives me nuts bc i do not care to watch it or hear it. I get us to at least mute it and put some tunes on. So much drunken revelry, people singing their hearts out to this song then the next. I’m trying to get us up to the top floor, with my strange affinity for it, unsuccessfully. I’m sitting up there alone playing Bowie for a bit, periodically going to the balcony to take in the view, smoke a cigarette. I return down to the pool room. One group keeps on winning, never losing a game. A few are seriously inebriated. The last to come to the house, cousin joey, arrives. A jolly but judging Canadian with a big beer belly. People begin to trickle out until just a few of us left. I chat with Joey while outside smoking. I see that I’m strangely trying to get something out of him by following him for a bit. He tells me a strange little story of an injury he recently had. How he was out drinking then walking home a mile or so away and he was found in a ditch by the road. How he did not remember how it happened. All he knew is that he woke up in the hospital. And I’m listening to this mysterious occurrence looking at his car, a little sporty 2 door car. And cig after cig and quickly realise his thoughts are inconsistent, diplomatic, condescending. Eventually the night ends.

The next day is Saturday, the last day and night in the house. No skiing. Just a day in the house, hanging out. The first thing we do is head to the small park nearby, to do the most American of activities - throw around a football. Simple throws here and there and occasionally one throwing and receiver and cornerback, who will win? It was good to get the heart beating. A strangely scenic area, with an old train bridge going overhead. A local hangout, the kids in their own little area over the gate - in the tiny wooded area. We return and many of us head to the bar while a few of us stick around the house and play some games. Catan then cards against humanity. I’ve begun to drink wine, a bottle of white wine. Just the three of us sitting and playing, my two driving companions. And then the hot tub when folks begin to return from the bar. It’s a bunch of us in their. Everyone drinking, trying to milk experience out of the last day here. Random conversations, tunes playing. One says this is one of the best albums ever, Strangeways here we come, if you put this on with a girl you’re bound to get laid. He speaks of a movie that he says is one of the best movies of modern times, interstellar, how he watched it during a plane ride and it made him cry. This man so opinionated, love - what is love? Of course he had an answer in the most affirmative of mannerisms, it’s a business transaction. That’s all it boils down to. Personally, I’ve often called it a decision, not entirely different of a definition. One of us in the hot tub is a romantic, this appalls him, he mutters this and that about emotions and beauty. But he’s speaking to two unsentimental realists, with minds that are barely willing to entertain poetic notions. Which is quite contradictory within myself, seeing how often i used to allow my thoughts to wax poetic. Perhaps it’s what happens when you move to such an obscure beat, over time - disillusion. During this time a few of us had been going for a dip in and out of the stream passing by. Now, while the stream moves so intensely- sounding like a perpetual storm - it is shallow, only a foot or so deep. So we would go in for a dip, sit on the stones beneath for a moment then get out, go back in the hot tub now and again. Freezing runoff from the melting snow of the nearby mountain. In the hot tub scenes have been going on around us. A man came with a wheel barrel of wood for a fire - thanks to Joey bc ‘Joey makes friends wherever he goes’. A fire has started up. People had been grilling meats in the bbq. And eventually it was just 2 of us left, me and the romantic. And we had known each other for years but for some time our friendship had hit a rough patch. And me, after having more than a bottle of wine, was prepared to talk to him in that heady way he’s so prone to. Oh friendship and the confusion, because of jealousy for a woman - i say, because of jealousy that i am usually better than him at this and that - he says. And yes i care for you, yes i love you as a friend. And I’m reminded of this odd thing he’d been doing during the trip. We’re sleeping in the same room, two separate beds, but i would wake up and he’d do the oddest thing. He would try to cuddle me. And I’d simply make a curious face and let him for a few moments. And comments he is prone to making, oh you’d be the one on the bottom if we were in a relationship. How his ex would tell me that he thought i had feelings for him. How everyone would say that he always talked about me. And these thoughts of love, these proclamations, i see he may love me in a romantic sense, not as a friend. And this thought appalls me, this may be the reason of our feud, he feels too much for me - i am making space, working to diminish his feelings for me. This is not to say one is entirely at fault, i may not have felt anything in a romantic sense, i had been continually attentive, continually giving my time to him. Eventually it’s time to head back inside, to be social. The first thing that is noticed is Janice being social, drinking wine. I remember she said some sort of insanity to me, and i told her to stop being ridiculous. The food ready, tacos. Someone made pulled pork, another steak, guacamole, this and that. I’m sitting there eating and she comes up to me, again insane, with the dreaded brownie in hand and begins to sprinkle some into my tacos. At this point, anger, taking things away from her, telling her to relax. She soon has vanished. Next thing i known in hear she’s sick. Someone is bringing her water, another attentive to her. She’s vomiting. She’s knocked out. Her night is over. And while her bf is attending to her. I sit with Catalina and she looks me in the eye and says does he know that you’ve been sleeping with his ex? No not yet i say. You have to tell her, she says. And an anecdote I’ve heard her say many times, the one thing i cannot stand is if someone lies to me - don’t tell Jay - but I’m fine if he ever cheated on me but told me, that can be worked through, but if he did then didn’t tell me and lied about doing this. I’m done, it’s over between us. This is the one thing i cannot stand, being lied to. And she has a point, i can’t hold this from him any longer and tell her, tomorrow i will tell him. Soon after i am definitely feeling the bits of brownie, not nearly to the level of the other day, but still i am high. We play pool and talk and drink, people begin filtering out for the long drive home tomorrow. I remember, talking to him that night by the stairs, he also had brownies sprinkled in his tacos by her and we looked at this image taken of me today. Me, laying in the freezing stream, being told to wait while my picture is taken, this look of pain and my naked body strange in appearance - the stream making it appear misshapen. We laughed non-stop for many minutes. Zooming into my pained face, my confusingly shaped body. Only a few left, and we are sitting on the couch, chatting - about all things - geopolitics. Ukraine. Putin, the strong man, his last show of hurrah. The horror. The confusion felt about the situation, in general. Me, perpetual devils advocate, wondering if putin is somehow doing good. The psychology of a civilisation. What is Europe? What is Russia? What can be done? What is there that can be done? Always i push to get back to the practical matters. What can one do from an ocean away? What does my words, thoughts, my being informed do? What is there to do? Eventually, we call it a night.

The last day. I wake up, eat a little and pack. Everyone lingering. We clean up the place. Gather the leftover food and booze. And there’s some time to meander. I decide to take in the nature for a bit more time. Walking up and down the stream connected to the backyard, going down the small hill, looking for rocks. Feeling the cold if the water, taking in the movement of the stream - it’s sound and shape, dwelling on nature - my frequent lack of it living in the city. This place, here for so short a time, but the memory of it is so vivid. The water rolling by, rocks shimmering, trees overlooking, a sound constant and peaceful. A stream wild and barren. Everyone says their goodbyes. We begin to drive back. She drove, i sat in the passenger seat, he sat in the back. We drove on, the first place we stopped was a country store. It had all sorts of odd country things but i mainly remember the people, a bunch of folks like us in appearance, in vacation, stopping on the way home. Bought a little bird whistle, mints, a big pickle in a plastic bag. On we went, arriving eventually at her neighborhood in Harlem. An interesting little spot, quite close to st Nicholas park, a park I’ve walked up many times when i went to city university. Then the two of us headed back to the enterprise. We went out for a few drinks at halyards. First play some darts, the game where you go down from 301 and cricket. We’re drinking one drink after the next. Then moved onto backgammon, which i hadn’t played in years, so i watched a quick video and figured out the rules to play a few games. And then it felt like time to tell him, just as i told cata the day before, that I’d been sleeping with his ex. So i just said it, and it caught him by surprise, but there was no anger, just questions. Yes we’d been having sex. Yes it’s casual. Just don’t hurt her he says, if you think you can, back out. Of course, i say. And finally that’s done. A load off my conscience. Hiding things from people creates such confusion. You must continually check yourself. And when it’s an ex, she tells you things you don’t want to hear but it gets said in moments of intimacy about the other. How much easier it is to feel sentiment towards the one you touch than ones you do not. These things i write about her, i never wanted him to read in terror of him discovering this in such a way. But it felt not so heavy to say it, and we didn’t speak much more about it. We went home, to finally get some rest.

## april 2022

Saw sunny on Tuesday. Went to the seafood restaurant. Raw clams, mussels, a burger. Upstairs and sex. She’s trying to buy a house. She moved to nj, living there for free. Slept over. Played shuggie Otis.

The next day saw Emma and worked at the coop. Working at the coop in the basement. Pallets of goods, unwrapped, organized. The main workers, a man from Australia and another. Both characters, people of their own style, way of looking a the world. Such a strange character of the place. The personality is this odd form of Brooklyn hippie. By all appearances, quite normal but in a way that their sense of style is very makeshift, not ordered. And a mindset, quite heady, strangely intellectual. Individual character. Another of the workers, as hipster as they come, an odd job as a kind of mechanic, but a musician on the side, amicable by nature. I barely stop moving, one pallet after the next. And eventually done, off to work. Biking to bushwick. The bar in bushwick. She told me about going back to school to get her phd in philosophy at cuny. 9 bucks for a shot of fernet and a glass of red. She, attractive body but quite nerdy face, thick glasses. She’s interested in the philosophy of language. Mentioned the word hamster, to hoard. Had only the one drink, left. Started kissing on the street. We spoke of the odd church on the way. Modern, bright lights on all around it, why these lights, why so flashy? Back to her place, again lots of kissing at the door. Then went in. A pretty nice place. Her room, quite a few records, a bit mitski framed thing. A bunch of poetry and philosophy books on the bookcase. No condoms but oral sex. And lots of kissing. And she’s a quite aggressive kisser, especially when she’s on top, quite controlling but it’s a good kiss with her. I decided to go around 1 am. Before going i asked her what book is her favorite one here. Opened it, a kind of strange creative non fiction poetry book, a mixture of prose and poetry, a modern book. And began flipping though it, finding parts she underlined and read it out loud. Bits about lovers and about el Camino de Santiago. I left, biked home.

Sick the next couple days. On Friday, went to sunnys bar for catas art opening. One of the first real hang outs outside of ski trips and post soccer drinking with these folks. Mainly drinking Narragansetts. They spoke of jacks wedding party. An event space in Williamsburg, where there was an endless amount of booze to drink. All sorts of fancy wine gratis. How they kept going after the event space. How they couldn’t find Miguel. Jays expression of - i know where he is - that smirking look, and found him in the girls bathroom asleep. Inside, the character of sunnys bar. The large group of us there. How whenever something is said to happen so many show up in this group. The music, folk psychedelic but also singing Spanish songs. The singer, beautiful playing an accordion. Two other band mates, one on the guitar and the other on the cello, occasionally playing the piano as well. How another group of musicians showed up, the way they added to the music playing, harmonica solos, other odd instruments, claps, the triangle. I joined in. Me mainly watching alone, not desirous to live in drunken revelry but to experience. Then the music ended, to the front of the bar. Where we chatted for hours longer. We spoke of books, with Alex’s gf, who has worked at the nypl for over 10 years. How this is the thing that bothers her the most about him, that he rarely reads. Carl, a gay man was there, speaking of David byrne, how he recently saw him live, how amazing it was. Why? I forget. The moment i realised how much i liked Steve, how open to connection a human he was. Then home.

The next day i saw another girl in williamsburg. Immediately aware i could never really be attracted to her but still decided to fully experience. We sat at this fancy cocktail bar, asked her about acting. The bar full of class. Every bit of it decorated like you’d expect a speakeasy at the beginning of the 20th century to be. Old wallpaper, chandeliers, dimmed lights, the bar with see through gates between the customers and the bartenders. Fancy cocktails. She does endless auditions for anything acting related. She works with a masters degree program at Columbia as a hired actress for mainly Shakespeare, she mainly does Shakespeare stuff. The ceaseless thought, here i am with this woman quite objectively unattractive. While being in a place with people so very attractive, and the thought cannot leave my mind, I’m embarrassed but realize this thought is foolish, that it’s best to enjoy the experience, learn from the other, perhaps there is potential here, may as well continue on. We go to this bar I’ve been wanting to go to sometime a couple blocks away, Pete’s candy store. Interesting spot, busy. She knew the bartender from some kind of Shakespeare camp upstate. She’s from Florida, went to nyu. We spoke of creativity, reading. Eventually left, and decided to kiss her, simply to see what it was like. A kind of messy and sloppy kiss but it’s nice to touch. And the thought, am i going to take her home? But she had to wake up early, and did i really want to in the first place. Took a citi Bike home.

Sunday, soccer and stuff. Remember talking to Oscar. A man that moved to the city from France while young, went to school. He took a job for a company in France that makes fancy gift bags for parties of rich folk. Think a little bag to take when you get to the party. He’s the only person at the company working in the states. All is his responsibility here. A good looking man, a nice voice, convincing way of speaking, long curly hair and voice quite jubilant, a laugh that echoes. He’s a part of some exclusive dating app, raya, that he referred me on. Waited a few days and nothing, i do not have an instagram.

The next day Karol arrived into the city. Met in the uws. First to Jake’s dilemma. Andrew, Karol, me and rob. Went to this ramen spot after. On the way there, spoke to rob, who works at a bait and tackle shop in city island, been working there on and off for so many years. He started on the fishing boats, where they do fishing tours but eventually moved into the shop. He gets all sorts of odd bait. Sand worms, night crawlers, bloodworms, all sorts of chopped up fish. He has to continually handle them, portion them, worms and dead fish all day long. The worms often get shipped from Maine. How whenever they don’t have a certain kind of bait, everyone asks for it. How this always happens, people want what they don’t have. The bidet, laughter. We get to the ramen spot. Ramen and beers. And, the pictures there are so odd, there are like animated little girls in suggestive hentai-like positions. Rob, leaving early, put on a show, he called out the cooks in front of us at the counter and gave each a 10 dollar bill, and for his appetizer and sake, left a 20 dollar tip before going. Just me and Karol at dive bar, that’s the name of the bar. Began planning to go to a yankee game. Him talking about andrew hitting the ball over the fence.

Saturday. Remember going to the park. Sitting and writing facing the picnic house in prospect park. Adults playing football behind me. A strange kids park. Remember this lonesome child, or rather a child that a father had to keep telling to come back, in worry of stranger danger. A man reading a medical paper, one that doctors read. On the way back, Sam wants to hang out. And wants to hang out with soccer folks. So i nervously message jay mentioning Sam wants to get drunk bc of how well the spurs are doing. He’s at sunny’s bar, come by he says. So i go, Sam and Ahran are there when i get there. As is Steve, jay, Barbara, cata, Andy and April. Remember the strange feeling of showing up and the constant occurrence in my life, my name chanted, Jerry Jerry Jerry like in Jerry springer. People love to flatter, especially if it’s a spectacle. We sit and chat about football while sitting on the stage where the musicians play. After a few we head to hometown bbq. Steve had left and a new guy has randomly joined the group, no one knew him before. I remember seeing him when i arrived at the bar and seeing the woman he was talking to at the bar seeming so disinterested in him. And another man showed up who she immediately glued herself to. He told me later that he randomly started talking to her after witnessing her bf and her getting into a heated argument. He then sat with her for quite some time and she told him this and that about the relationship. While sitting cata is the central character in the group. She keeps mentioning how everyone’s wierd with that sky look am she so frequently has, that little smirk. Everyone is wierd she says, many hide it while others embrace it. She says that’s a reason she likes me, how i embrace how weird i am. Rest of the group comes back with food. All sorts of meat. Brisket is everyone’s favorite. Andy talks about Jewish brisket and it sounds probably better than bbq brisket. It’s more a stew, slow cooked meat dish with fruits and veg mixed in, healthier. We eat then head to the next spot, a brewery in this idyllic spot of red hook, near the water and the park, with the Statue of Liberty in view. While there Steve and his gf, melody show up. And Miguel. I sat at one end of the table, where Steve and melody, Sam and ahran sat. Melody spoke of her new job at code academy. She helps make a course as a contractor. This is oddly her first job as a designer, odd as this is one of the most popular learn to code websites, and this is their first course on design, and she’s brand new to the industry, and she has her hands deeply in it. An amazing beginning, her future is set. I was drinking strong breakfast beers poured into fancy little glasses, a thick and creamy beer. Next to us was most likely a bachelorette party for an Indian woman. A somber affair, most likely highly educated women, never taking steps too far. That place closed round 12 and we headed to another bar. On the way there back we had to walk down this quiet and desolate path that felt very odd to go down, the bar literally hidden at the end of the path right before hitting the water. Passed a business that, strangely, cata did the branding for, her side business. Remember her telling me that she still does this business but stopped doing websites, bc developers are the worst at time and money estimation, everything costs more and takes much more time than what is specified. The third bar, another brewery again only a few blocks away. How strange is red hook, there are bars, yes, but they are spaced out and hidden, you have to know they are there, what odd block to walk down. And while there, so empty, but spacious, big ceilings. And a surprise, the bartender plays music by jukebox the ghost, the lead singer is a friend of ours who we play soccer with, and who some of us are very close to. Some of us have been there before and asked him to play them, and coincidentally he loved the band, listened to them all the time in the past. So we’re part of his inner circle, and the bartender is enamoured. Keeping the bar open later than he probably should, staying open solely for us though he’s barely making any more money. A story about matty, who was to move to portland in a few weeks, how they were bar hopping in this area years ago and Matty separated from the group and waited at this bar for them, where is matty they wondered, texted and he said where he was, and when a few of them showed up he had 10 beers poured in front of him - thinking more people would come - but many left, so just he and a few others had to drink all those beers. I was talking to Barbara and she mentioned Jay’s brothers child, who lives near her in Long Island, she’s a proper grandmother to this child and the brothers wife’s other child from another relationship. She mentions how this child of his was born months prematurely. 3 or 4 months. In the past a child born that early had no chance of survival. But now, they can keep these babies alive. Tubes that give oxygen and food. A light and setting that tries to replicate still being within the womb. Until the child is strong enough to leave the hospital, months in the hospital. Constant visitations. Barely allowed to touch the child. Sensory deprivation. Continual worry of it’s passing but it’s now a handful of years old, doing fine and looking fine, looking quite smart. The only problem is that he has very poor eyesight, but otherwise functioning fine. But the constant worry about the fact that this practice is quite new, will there be long term consequences? We go, very drunkenly, i have my bike to ride home, i listen to the only place by big thief over and over on the way back.

I had to get up hungover the next day bc i said I’d see a football game with this same crew the next day that started at 11. We kept speaking of breakfast beers the day before and i said I’d bring some so stopped at Whole Foods on the way. Was much the same crew but with the addition of a husband and wife and their child. And the dog, Dante, and the kitten, dobbie. After the game played with the animals, the cat absolutely adorable, constantly doing that possessed cat jump. Playing and playing. Soccer in the afternoon. After playing, during drinks, remember speaking to a man that ran moth story events at a bar near me. He spoke of how those that usually win tell stories quite extreme, unbelievable life events. And that, quite often the same folks win, and he knows that some fabricate or replace certain facts with more extreme and amazing facts to capture the audience. How the core component is being a storyteller, as you’re up on stage telling this story. How he has heard people speak of such amazing life experiences but be so poor at telling their story that it gets perceived as uninteresting. This night felt like the beginning of a goodbye to Matty, who had been playing soccer with this group for so many years, and was to leave for Portland after next Sunday. And several of us lingered, savouring some of his final moments.

Monday, mike showed up. He’s living with his dad in Atlantic city. Mike, a troubled man, he tried to commit suicide several times. He never could get his shot together. Never finishing school, never having a serious job. And my friend Karol, got him to come for a few days to work for him (he does contracting, mainly painting work, his favorite jobs are when he does Venetian plaster). He had to call mikes dad to get him to come, so difficult it being to get him to come. Karol told me how disgruntled this made him, the difficulty in getting mike to show up, participate. So mike will sleep at my place for a couple nights and work for Karol 3 days. On Tuesday we’ll go to a yankee game. Mike was a best friend of mine for many years during elementary and middle school and I’d see him throughout high school. Always a rare specimen, tall and gangly, but with an elegant Italian looking face, he was always dating one woman or another. The woman he was dating for the longest, Kayla, is still a close friend of many within this group, especially Karol. Funny how the memory of some brings back a sequence of memories, an attempt to explain the character of another. After finishing work i met them in the city, mike and karol. We met at a random bar, sitting there for a beer. When I show up, I’m so happy to see mike, there’s something about him that i love. It’s all the memories, the fact that with certain people you’ve spent so much time with its as if you continue right where you left off with them. The conversation, the way of communication, is interlocked with such an assortment of memories. And with him, i can joke so freely and then instantly jump into something deep, existential, personal. It’s as if a large part of my identity is within him, awakes when he is in my presence. A quick drink, a Korean restaurant where i had some bimimbap. Then to a bar nearby. Mike, this man that continually concerns me, the fact that he’s tried to commit suicide several times, the fact that he’s never had a full time job, the fact that he’s always lived with his parents, the fact that he seems to simply drift through life, never a plan, never an idea of his future. It terrifies me. And i can’t help but speak these things, i cannot help bluntly asking wtf are you doing with your life? How many times I’ve told him to get into programming, he’s always been smart. Always performed well on tests, iq tests and that test you take to get into specialized high schools in the city. He went to Bronx science. But always women in his life, women are the focus, love and all that. What appears to matter to him is the philosophical, the incongruent - not a practical bone in his body. While we’re outside smoking a cigarette, he tells me about a problem he was trying to solve. Start at a dot, which is on a triangle, that is connected to an infinite number of triangles - whereas the lines on the triangle are the paths - it can go one step at a time - from one edge of the triangle to another or another triangle. How many ways, after n steps, are there for the dot to return to its original point? He tells me that he spent days thinking about this, of what the equation is. All i can think of is that if he loves to do this, he should get into coding. In the software industry, so many companies will hire you if you can solve their programming puzzles. The data is that done can and others cannot do this well, some have higher intelligence, others do not. Oh and all the practice ofc. He can do this, do it, i tell him. It’s an escape route, think of all the possibilities, in woman, in lifestyles. He acquiesces but I’m so doubtful he’ll listen and try. Back in the bar Karol tells me a thing I’ll hear him tell me many times, people don’t do things when you tell them to, you have to be more subtle, convincing, smoother. And he’s likely right but, in my mind, so much is now or never. If i don’t say it now, when will i? When will i next see mike? How much time will i have to tell him? Karol, depressed bc the Yankees lost, he watches so many of their games. And more than that, they’ve been losing quite a bit at this time. Me and mike begin to head back. I want his opinion of my writing, and show him something but he does not give me a positive review. He tells me that i am so unattached. Someone is crying in front of me and my commentary speaks of of how i do not understand the tears. He speaks of how, me being a central character in this story, how can others relate? Why would someone want to read something unrelatable? And he has a point. We head into the subway. He’s making me wonder if another art would be better for me, i think of film. Looking at this scene in front of me, such a scene can be imagined here. The old security footage cameras in the some subway stations. One can have something happening within the screen, and the effect of it, silent and distant and ugly, will of course stir an emotion. So much like this exists in the world, creative ways to create an moving image. We’re back in bk, in my neighbourhood and i can’t help but sell this place, all it has to offer, you can live here - you’d be so much happier here if you just focused on getting your life in order.

Tuesday, went to the Yankee game after work. The first baseball game I’ve been to in many many years. A group of us, Karol, andrew, kyle (crack), mike, and rob. They’re at a bar near the stadium, all but Andrew and crack, everyone calls him crack. I get there and see that a champions league game is playing, Chelsea vs Real Madrid. I thought Chelsea was out after losing the first leg 2 - 0 but the second leg is now in overtime, 3 - 3 on aggregate. And benzema, scores again, he’s always scoring this season, and the Real Madrid beat the team that won this tournament last year. We’re sitting there drinking, 3 beers and 2 shots for me and for some insane reason i have bottles of gin in my pocket to bring into the stadium. Why the desire to drink so much? Alcoholism. Andrew arrives and soon we begin heading to the stadium. This area of the bronx, so memorable. The bronx Supreme Court, this feeling of history, buildings that have been there for so many years, roads that have been continually walked, one feels so much energy from this place. And rob, being rob, has a ridiculous situation to handle, he has a pocket knife in his pocket, and there are metal detectors to get into the stadium - he hides it in a little garden nearby on a very busy street. We head to the game, i scoff a sausage on the way. Through the detectors, my gin in plastic containers are not found. But my heart is beating on the way in.
M And we’re in the spectacle. Full baseball fields are very large, you feel a part of such a view. The deep green of the field, the dark blue seats in all directions, the people everywhere flowing this way and that, the big sky above, the strange symmetry of the field, the huge screens, the continual reverberations of sound. We walk along the main promenade and take in the energy around us. A group shows up on the way with a man in front, this man is roaring, let’s go Yankees! Let’s go! With that intense glare, flexing his muscles, taking in everyone staring at him - look at my impressive physique, and it was impressove. He looks like a warlord whose behaviour would fit as a scene in a Greek tragedy. A troop of men showing up with the leader roaring in front, a boastful, aggressive, and thoughtless group which has come to sew chaos. Keep walking, what is there to buy? I’m diving head first into the booze, one after the other, what am i going to drink? The standard appears to be big cans of Stella Artois, for not too exorbitant a price, 15. We arrive at our seats, game about to start, a quick look around and see quite a few kids sitting here and there. The game begins and I’m talking to crack as we’re all the way to the left. I had not spoken too much with him throughout the years, even though I’ve known him for at least 16 years, a high school friend of Karol’s. He hasn’t been drinking for a couple of years, and was never a particularly energetic or assertive communicator so it’s up to me to bring the conversation into existence. One thing I’ve always found fascinating about him is that he’s worked at a graveyard in westchester for many years. And, with complete conviction, i told him, next time you have to bury someone, definitely let me know. I’ll help you dig. He says there’s a burial once a month or so and when there is he will let me know. It’s a lot of work for one person, he said. During this time karol began yelling at the Yankees outfielder that was within earshot, saying slightly negative things - i had to tell him to shush, don’t f with the psychology of our team, f with the psychology of their team. And that was when this foolish notion clicked, i have to mess with their team, what can i do? I wondered inward then out loud, who is this guy? What’s his heritage? He’s Cuban I’m told. And then such taboo comes loudly out of my mouth, im chanting Castro, Castro, Castro. Calling this man Castro, communism this and that, one incoherent thing after the next. And I’m getting looks but too out of it to care. The game continues on, and this became my mission, psychological warfare, I’ve had too much to drink, i have too much pent up energy. And, crack moved to my right, mike to my left. These two, so very inward, so responsive but not creative in their dialogue, I have to release energy outward, separately. Later in the game the outfielder on our team near us hits a home run, and one quite pivotal. So yells to him, cheers for him, good feelings in his direction the rest of the game. But when the other comes back, i see a better, a stranger point of attack - his flashy blonde styled hair. Rubio! Ruuubio! Sensitivo ruuubio! In my poor Spanish. And i said this over and over, so many times, it was absolute insanity. Looks from those around me. Can picture clearly the little girl and her father sitting to the left a row below, this look of confusion, confounded. A group of young boys in the front with a similar look. Behind me, a few rows back to the right, a man with an amused look. More beers and some peanuts, the best kind of peanuts, the ones with the shells still on them, crack upon crack. The game is running to its close. Near the end of the game, mike got me up to get some food. We go in search of halal guys, which mike said he saw a sign for. It’s on the top deck he says. And we go on our way, winding through the stadium, eventually reaching the top and finding it. We are looking over the spectacle, it’s really such a scene. Beyond the game, beyond a concert, beyond anything that people go to a stadium for, there is the stadium, and it truly is at the backbone of the experience. We head back and reach our seats and i realise my phone is missing. I go back up to halal guys, not there, to the spot i bought beer, not there, lost and found, not there. And i return dejected, mike hands me my phone, he was thinking of pranking me, not realising i would go out in search with mad energy. We leave, take a cab to the uws with Karol, another drink, and we head back to Brooklyn. Mike’s last night at my place. A small scene happens, i had asked him yesterday, in the morning, this night - want some water? And i ask again, he says yes, at which point i proceed to drink several glasses of water directly in front of him, then going to get his. Off to bed.

On Saturday was pete’s baby shower. Pete is someone I’ve been playing soccer with for sometime. And, he’s one of the sweetest of guys, always relaxed, always aware, always conscious and kind. And he works for the purest of employers, the UN. He and his wife, Circe, are having a child in may. The gathering was near the picnic house in prospect park. A table and chairs, people and the park, a wide view. I get there and the group is mainly folks i do not know, a few i do. This man who used to frequently play soccer, jack, is there, with his 1 year old and wife. The child, huge for its age, supposedly in the top 95% of children by size at that age. Eventually more and more i know arrive. All likely a bit surprised that I’m there, many have known him for many years but I’m quite new to the group and one of the only unexpected ones there. But I’ve spoke to Pete many times over the past few months about his coming child. All the little things he plans to do, a professional they’ve hired to guide them through the entire process, pregnancy difficulties, post birth education, etc. More than anything, an education for myself if ever i go through the same. I brought a bottle of wine, knowing that drinking was surely to happen, even if this started at 1. We play a game, quite strange, original, fitting. Baby bottles filled with beer, who can finish first? The beer came out in the slowest of drizzles but some were creative - blowing bubbles allowing a faster stream - some spilled. All i know is it took minutes for any of us to finish 1/3 a bottle of beer. During this another wife and child I’ve never seen before showed up, cian, his wife, his energetic child - Al. The whole time, this child was running here and there, friendly with any other child. Things quickly turned into a bit of a party, music playing, mainly reggaeton. I chatted with Circe’s cousin, her only real family here. He was here from Pennsylvania with his three children and wife. He told me how he came up here when young - around 12, after his father was given a green card. How he did well in school, went to college, and now works as an X-ray technician at a local hospital. How he mainly sees wounds, gun and stab wounds. He’s seen so much he no longer flinches at the sight. Catalina, asks me to watch her apartment when her and Jay are gone in June, the dog and the cat. And the main scene for the rest of the day is Al, she’s everywhere, joining a Jewish party where every child has a mask depicting on of the 7 plagues, she has a mask of a sick cow. And then, her music is played and we’re in a circle and there she is, this adorable little girl, dancing in circles flapping her wings like a butterfly. And Catalina is lifting her up and down, flipping her and making her excited like mad. At one point I’m chatting with Jess, i look at her and say, whenever i look at you, i think of cats, and she laughs with glee, i honestly don’t mind that. In chat a bit with katharhy, where he speaks of his research, how he studies a process that is part of a bigger biological process, the one organisms use to make vitamin a. He studies it to find if there is a way to make it synthetically more efficiently, primarily useful for fortified foods, think rice and grain. GMO’s. But this is what he does for his masters. He plans to do a phd after, in economics, indigenous economics. The day ends, some go to see a basketball game, i meander on my bike but head home.

The next day was Easter. Working on being a better son, for these things i see my mother. So i suggested the botanical garden, and she and my sister and her bf were to go. Took the train from my neighbourhood and arrived for what would be on time but decided to watch a soccer game on the way. Quite a scene, primarily Mexicans but there was one black man, large and strong stealing the show. Such an aggressive game, tough challenges, every step of the way so very physical. One team wearing Liverpool, the other Manchester City jerseys. I decided to wait in a goal, and in front of where i was watching, a foul, the man i mentioned is to take the free kick, 10 or so meters from the goal, and he shoots - a shot with immense power that the man who was to block the shot ducked out of the way, in it went and off i went. Meet my mother. A trip to the bathroom and a man cleaning the grounds, playing golf with the small rocks in the way, looks at me and says you need to find a way to have fun, don’t cha? They think I’m nuts here but I’ve been here for 20 years, every little thing counts, gotta have some fun. My sister and her bf arrive and we decide to do the tram. Going through the grounds with little explanation here and there, these trees were planted by x, look to the left at the beautiful flowers. We get off by the mill house, where mom reminds us several times that she used to bring us here when we were young. We walk along the stream, to this odd waterfall kinda thing. Where here, she tells us how this was my fathers old stomping grounds when he was young, how he’d always come into the garden with his friends and hang out right here, right next to the waterfall. Quite a scene, quite a beautiful place to attach one’s history to. We head out to leave because I’m in a rush, i want a full day, to play soccer at 430, to be back in Brooklyn by then. We head to little Italy, to this Italian restaurant called Emilia’s. A nice place, it has Italian charm, i hear an Andrea bocelli song i cannot help but saving for later. The conversation becomes odd, about Ukraine, about people having to leave their pets behind when migrating to the US as often they are not given shots for rabies and this and that in Ukraine. And some people around me are arguing that this shouldn’t be something Ukrainians should be complaining about, but to be simply glad to be allowed to migrate here, forget the pets. And to me, all i hear is lack of appreciation for pets, for what they bring to a family. But I’ve learned by now that you don’t change peoples minds my arguing so i simply aim to change the subject before heading out. And head out i do, back to Brooklyn in a cab. The cab driver, a man from Burkina Faso, we speak of his dreams, a frequent topic when cabbies hear that I’m a software engineer. So many dream of doing this profession, as it is one they’ve heard stories about close to home. People they know who are now working in software, and how much more prosperous their lives are because of it. I tell him this and that. Stop watching so much football, maybe just watch the highlights on YouTube. You have to spend hundreds of hours learning to code if you want to break into the industry. Look up this online course and that, dedicate yourself, struggle, go through endless pain and stress and if you keep going, you can do it. And I’m home, soccer, drinks, home.

Saw Emma for the second time that Wednesday. Met her again in bushwick, a bar with no one in it but the two of us. Chatted about her life a bit, this and that. She grew up in the south, but her family moved to Ohio, to upper New York, to be a part of a more Jewish family. Her parents were both lawyers, public defenders. She works in a law office, as a secretary. I remember thinking of her diabetes, looking it up before meeting her again, realising that this is a disease that before the discovery of insulin was fatal within years. Cold feet, cold hands were spoken of. Her soon to start phd, she’s in a slack group now with her fellows. And, thankfully being the second time, touch was not a question but an expectation. We headed back to her place. While away, put on one of her records, one that I’ve always loved, galaxy 500s today. And the same old patterns, kissing and touching and clothing coming off. And she’s quite aggressive, she wants to be on top, she wants to direct things, control things. We finish, are done for now, to chat. I kept looking and commenting on this little Buddha rock sculpture she had, with 4 faces of differing expression. I pick it up, it and a little rhino sculpture. I do a little play, the main character being the angry looking Buddha. He complains of his misfortunes and pains. His lack of love from the rhino. He threatens the rhino that he’ll chop his horn off and sell it to the Chinese so they can make libido soup. And the other Buddhas make cameos, oh why must this other be a part of me, all he does is whine and cause me such consternation. Oh the weariness. And the rhino is a woman, complaining of its choice of the angry Buddha as a lover. The tragedy. I finish, though could have went on forever, and say my goodbye, bike home.

Been meaning to hang out with the main crew for a bit so did a board game day at Ryan and Jamie’s. Not a whole lot happened. Played cards against humanity and dominion. Drank a bottle of wine. Did a little play with Janice using Ryan’s homo heidelbergensis skull. He loves this topic, forensic anthropology. This skull of particular intrigue as it is very likely a subspecies of homo erectus, Homo sapiens ancestor. I acted as if the skull were still living, and thinking, decrying it’s state. Kyle goes and brings up one of his favorite topics, some strange band called bull of heaven that has a song that is quindecillion years old. And of course awkwardness is how the night ends with these folks, especially this narcissist kyle. And he leaves and she quickly follows, like a sheep. Ryan sputters out about them taking a break, her choice, oh i didn’t mean to say that. And i head out soon after, confused because i was going the same way. I see them further down the train but have no desire to speak to them. It’s a normal path in relationships, the one on one chat of personal and selfish thoughts, one must allow those that hide within themselves to continue doing so. At the root of so many sins there is the same thing, privacy.

Saturday was Matty’s going away celebration, at pig beach, a spot a literal block from my apartment. My first time there, and the crew wanted to come once again, kyle and Janice and Brian and lou Lou, sam and Ahran. And so many of the soccer folks were there of course. A big turnout. I spoke, for one of the first serious times with Ben. Ben, such an intentional communicator, looks you right in the eyes, takes in what you say, speaks directly in an unvarnished way right back to you. We spoke of creativity, he’s a pure creative, he makes a living as a musician, through the money his band makes - where he is the singer and the writer and the marketer and all of the other important things for. And thanks to this little chat we have a forever understanding, both in creative pursuits, dedicated to it - but where will i go he wonders. One of the strangest of coincidences happens, a professor for a degree i finished a few years back in computational physics, the one who taught machine learning was there as the wife of one of the men who frequently come to play, Samir. And we chat, why didn’t you pursue a higher degree, she says in her Italian accent. There’s a program, by the simons institute where they pay for your masters, you should look into it. Steve and his gf are there, Jerry! How are you? How’s the dating? She asks in her Philippine accent. They met on hinge, he and her, and every time he can he wants to look at my profile. He finds a girl, she’s cute, let me send her something. She has in her profile something about butt grabs as something important in a successful relationship. He writes, i prefer butt pinches. Nate is there with his pup, a corgi. He says, if you want a dog that’s basically a cat, that’s a corgi - it doesn’t give a shit about you - unless there’s food. Where’s your wife? I ask. Ah she’s hiding from me at her parents. Hiding? Well, she has a test for medical school. One of these tests that make you remember a ton of things. And if you do well on it, it sets you up for the future. She wants to be a dermatologist, they make a shit on of money. Chat with the main group. They’re off to the side and when i walk up there’s Brian brandishing a cig with a smirk, of course i take it. And they mention a girl that came up to them asking for a cigarette, thought she might be your type they say. And I’m chatting with Andy elsewhere, every thing we say to each other, a kind of appreciation of one another, this chemistry we are both aware of and cannot help but acknowledge. And all the time, matty is here and there, let’s have a shot, i acquiesce with a lift of the eyebrows. Tequila. And with us is the dude from Haiti. Dressed up and looking as clean as they come. A group of us head off to the next hang out, union hall a few blocks up. I ride up on someone’s bike, a strange experience being that it’s a fixie, something i have never seriously ridden. When we’re there i go straight to the bocce ball, passing through a huge crowd and all sorts of noise, claiming the floor. The crowd is all wealthy and young and clean in appearance. But the place is old, classy, with portraits and architecture reminiscent of a classy bar at the beginning of the 20th century in Manhattan. I gather a few players and we begin, I’m rowdy, inebriated. Cocky. The touch, one needs to have the touch, i say. You, Janice have the touch, i have the touch. Few have the touch. A bothersome ending, my teammate loses the game for us, not by failing to get a point but hitting our own balls out of the way. And we’re done. The rest of the night, or rather a few hours longer, our group is there, chatting and living in drunken revelry. Someone buys pot, i smoke, so now not only quite drunk but also stoned. The same aura from Kyle and Janice, talking amongst their selves, as if what they speak of means something special. Private communication, attachment. I am drawn to Andy and Samir. Then it’s just me and Andy. He asks me to tell him about my life. I don’t know much of anything about you! He says in his so raspy and loud voice. What do you want me to give a kind of job interview answer, selling myself? Absolutely not, i want a long and detailed story, touching every aspect of your life. You’re so closed in! Look at your posture, closed with your arms clasped. Why? I cannot help but smile, he’s right. I have a lot of experience in this, being a teacher, i want to understand you. I go something like, hmm one of the only things i really believe is the correlation with the physical self and one’s thoughts, behaviours. Yes! You should read, this is one of my favorite books, the mass psychology of fascism. I noted this then began to tell my story: well, i grew up in the bronx, in throggs neck. I know that place, i grew up right there! Over the bridge in Long Island. Amazing, i say, we’re basically neighbors. I went to elementary school in city island. Dad would drive me and my brother, sister every day because it was a much better elementary school than the one near us. He never wanted us to go to the catholic school near us, st Francis, he used to get hit by the ruler way too much, he was a trouble maker when young. He was a cop, my mom a public school art teacher mainly in hunts point. For high school, i got into one of those specialized schools, Brooklyn tech, but decided to go to Lehman high school instead. Wait, seriously? You went to Lehman? That’s one of the bravest things I’ve ever heard. The context being that the fact remained that, in many of my classes, i was the only white kid in class. I never thought it brave, i always thought of it as the only decision, there was no way I’d go to a catholic high school like many i knew and Brooklyn tech was over an hour and a half commute. Lehman! And soon after i felt a need to say, you must see though, in the vein of self deprecation, i look good why not wreck it? I say, a lot of people in my life have been fucked up, quite a few in aa, very close friends who have tried to commit suicide, one’s in institutions. Ah, you have to see I have it much worse, Andy says. My closest friend when i was a kid, we’d hang out just about every day, well, when he grew up he killed multiple people execution style. My mom still has tea with her. Another of my closest friends from high school is in jail right now for killing someone. Where i grew up was fucked up. What was your family like? I said. My mother was a single mother, and i was the only child, we grew up really poor, some of the poorest in the neighbourhood. She did all sorts of odd jobs, one of the main being a seamstress. And something came up so the conversation fizzled, let’s talk more about this Jerry! I’m always open to talking about these topics. Absolutely i say, but i wonder when it will happen again, it’s so much easier to bring these conversations to life when one’s boozing and stoned, but absolutely! A group of us go downstairs to the rave cave, to dance. I try to be friendly with kyle and Janice. He gets handsy, i get upset, i do some magician dancing, waving hands in front of him and he gets upset. He walks away, she follows. I get pissed. Angry, walk up and curse them, depressing humans i think. I go back upstairs, there is Courtade and aleks, his gf. Conversation about god knows what, probably football. I see cian, anyone see Matty? He’s been gone and this is his celebration, he probably just left, he’s known for Irish goodbyes. Found out later he went to a bar by himself, saw another lonely soul in a Celtics journey and hung with him for the rest of the night. I see his gf nearby, Gigi, drunk and tyrannical. You’re my favorite, she says to the Haitian. And there is another man she’s in council with, and intimacy is obvious, they have some kind of history. But back with Courtade and aleks, Courtade is to leave, he suddenly gives me a smooch on the forehead, my eyebrows raise, he tells me I’m a beautiful person, so i give him one back. And aleks feels left out, what about a kiss for me, you gotta say some sweet words to me if you want a kiss aleks. People go and Kyle and Janice are walking by and a careless goodbye, and again I’m upset, show some kindness you depressing creature i say, and i give him a push. He threatens me. And you Janice, stop following him, learn to be kinder, you’re holding yourself back. And the night hits it’s end. I feel no longer a need to be here.

The next day was my first friends bday. I’ve known her since i was 3. Grew up a block away from one another. Extremely close throughout childhood, less so during teenage years but still constant, and we’d barely seen each other while adults. In recent years, whenever i would see her, she was a completely changed person. Since we began drinking and doing drugs during our teenage years, she would constantly be the center of attention. The energy of the group. Often in the most obnoxious of ways, black out drunk, drama, all of this happened through her, because of her. But, in recent years, she’s been in AA and on a heavy dose of antidepressants. And, in recent years we’ve been working on rekindling our friendship. Me, her, and Jesse. Another of a the same story as her but he’s always been in control, put together, responsible. So i head to the gathering, out to the bronx, to her gfs apartment. I get there around 6. Just Jen and her gf are there. We decide to buy some weed at the store up the block, this new fact, the ability to buy weed everywhere in this city. We get it, smoke some of it and head back to the apartment, her brothers there, Will. A man so ingrained in the neighborhood i grew up in, frequenting the bars for years, constantly in contact with my own brother, who is a bartender at one of the more popular bars around town. The area the apartment was in, a very nostalgic place, very close to a where a friend i was very close to lived, Sean - where he still lives. And the McDonald’s, the landmark among landmarks in the neighborhood, the constant begging to go there while a child. And my father, was not remotely a prude when it comes to food. Soon, we’re seated at the kitchen table. There’s a ton of food in front of us. Potato salad, rice and beans, chicken wings, empanadas. We eat and chat. And, things first revolve around will and Jen speaking of their parents. They mention this cartoon from the past, the big heads from rockos modern life - husband and wife - where every scene the two of them are yelling at each other, one obscenity after the next. Will, who, for forever has been a neighborhood vagrant, constantly out and about in the bars, has recently gotten a government job. He’s no longer able to booze day in, day out, in bed by 10. To take the trip up to the Wall Street area. A job where he gets case after case of people looking for government housing. One after the next, and it’s not he that decides, he has information to gather, and he gathers it. Passes it along and is told, yes or no. But to these folks, this is something extremely important to them. Expectations layered upon expectations. If they don’t get it, they will not know. The answer from will, I’ll contact you. But they keep calling, desperately. You don’t tell them they didn’t get it? Hell no, he says, I’m not gonna be the one to tell them that, it’d break their heart. So they live in limbo until they give up. Will soon leaves and it’s just 3 of us. Jens gf points out a painting on the wall, do you recognise this? And after a moments glance i see it looks just like something my mother would have done, is it hers? And it is, she says. Strangely enough, though this is the first time i met her, she’s been going to Bible study with my mom for several years. What a strange point of connection. A strange fact that one of my closest friends when young is now seriously dating this woman. I begin to try to understand her. Where are you from? The bronx, the hood, in grand concourse. Her parents were from Puerto Rico. She has 9 full brother/sisters. 9. And two half’s from her father. One after the next. They grew up in a tight apartment. And were a part of a very strange church. Her child and teenage years revolved around the church. School in the day, church at night almost every single day. She was required, during these years in the church to wear a long wool skirt, meek and plain clothing. Think of it, her in a public school deep in the bronx, surrounded by the noise and flashiness inherent in this culture, dressed like a nun. Not only that but she was a youth leader, the girl in charge at the church, an exemplar. She spoke of their rituals, the need to dress a certain way and follow exact movements during prayer. Of how, when one did wrong, cut their hair, dressed inappropriately, caused trouble - the punishment was that they had to wear a full body wool outfit, wool nun-wear. How this outfit was so itchy, how they were expected to wear it all the time. And then i looked around her kitchen, at what pictures were on the refrigerator - she has two kids, who are living with her ex in westchester. Cute and happy looking children. She sees them here and there nowadays. And for work, she’s been in hr at non profits for many years but is currently in between jobs. Housing for LBGT individuals, if i remember correctly. And she mentioned the same refrain as will, the worst was when she had to fire people. She spoke of people ceaselessly crying, of how the pain from doing this carried into her out of work life. Someone i hadn’t seen for so many years showed up soon after, Roxanne, a haunt for many years in my life. A crush during my teenage years. And she was just as I remembered her, wild energy with a very curvy body. She was dressed with everything out there and discernible, her big breasts and behind. She wore the strangest croc like shoes I’d ever seen, sci fi like, reminiscent of the feet of some kind of reptilian alien. I asked her about her family, seeing as that was a constant topic today. Oh, my parents were very loving and secure, but I haven’t always been so good to them. And she’s chatting along, she has drama in her life. Ah, so the other day i was taking a cab to work (she works in sunset park) but there was some kind of marathon going on and all of the roads were closed, the driver literally drove all around the perimeter and couldn’t get in, so he dropped me a bunch of blocks away. But! They charged me for all of this and it came out to almost 200 dollars! I need to get my money back, that’s just too much but there’s no number to call! Stuff like this at first, complaints. Soon after, Jesse shows up. He has troubles as well, but they’re spoken of in a much more monotone voice. So I’m driving without a license nowadays (he delivers food for work) because I’ve had way too many unpaid tickets. I got pulled over the other day, and they arrested me. Spent the night in prison. Ya it blew. Then back to the group and i remember speaking of other basic info with the group. Roxanne is working at a company where she fills pill bottles, a startup that delivers pills to your door. Jen complains of her job, what am i doing with my life? She works on one of those Amazon delivery cars. Her gf is looking for a new job. Jesse needs to get his car in order before running away from the city to wander around the west coast. Roxanne speaks of her parents moving to city island. They just saw a condo there, the tall ones. I speak of the only time I’ve been in one of those buildings, to see a classmate who was kinda a friend during elementary school, corey. I slept over his house a few times when we were kids, i specifically remember the pool in his yard, how it was covered and we were playing some ball game. The ball fell on the tarp and i went to get it - quickly realised that i was sinking into it - and ran across the entire tarp, which was wide because it was a large pool, and the entire time water was splaying feet high around me. Back at the condos, my one time seeing him, it was with my friend karol. We went up to his room, to smoke some weed. And, before this, some strange animosity had been building up btw us. And the way i look at people, quite direct. Something inside of him triggered, while going through the box where he keeps his drugs. He pulls out a knife. And he’s looking at me, with a feeling that he’s considering jumping at me. With karol between us. And i asking corey questions about his life, questioning him about this behaviour. We smoke, chat for a bit longer - all of the time he’s still holding the knife. Soon as it felt like time, me and karol left. And, the last i heard of Corey, he’s now in jail. Pulled over with a shotgun in his car. And i wondered out loud of how he became this. His mother went to Harvard, a successful woman. I said he had good genes, one would expect him to be smarter, more put together. And immediately revoked what i said, i hate that I said that. Roxanne goes, i hate that you said that too. It’s more about the little things you do, anyone can be smart, i go not wanting to broach this subject. But she continues on, but i mean some people just are, it is true. I go, well that is what the data says regarding specific traits but success is generally dependent upon your upbringing. And things fizzle. She mentions that she is looking for a new apartment to move into. She speaks of these apartments in Mott haven, the first stop into the bronx on the 6 train. She goes on about how the apartments are absolutely beautiful but the neighborhood is full of crime. Shootings just about every day. I mentioned yesterday chatting with Andy, we have this chemistry, this vibe that just works between us. I mentioned his troubled past. At around 1 we call it. Goodbyes and hugs and happy birthdays. What a strange time, seeing this woman i was obsessed with as a teenager once again. But i cannot deny that that whole night we had chemistry, we had an understanding.

A couple days later i met up with karol and Kayla. We met at some spot in the uws. I hadn’t seen her for some time. I came with a great little thing to say. How on Friday i ran into an old professor. On Sunday, my mothers painting just happened to be at Jen’s gfs place. And as a side effect mentioned Jen’s brother, calling him one that lived by getting over the day before, ie a big partier. And Kayla loved that phrase, a huge laugh, so i thought today will be fun. Karol and Kayla are very close friends, frequently chatting on the phone for hours. And we’d never hung out like this, just the three of us. We went to another bar, and got karol to start talking about his drug dealing days. When he went to school in North Carolina, he began selling. He’d buy it off another classmate from elementary school, nick, and get it driven to him from city island by a friend, Jason. Karol has a fitting personality for dealing, aggressive and commanding and of a large stature but also agreeable, friendly, great at communicating and explaining himself. His many years at being the man, the one many wanted to be friends with, the one with the goods. He continued doing this when he moved back to the city, when he lived in bushwick for sometime. He lived in one of those modern apartment buildings in an area quite hood. Full of white folks in a predominantly black and Spanish neighborhood, gentrification. His dealing partner at the time was a local, born and raised right there. He mentioned that, when he first started dealing here, the local dealers took it as an affront, but being that his partner was from the area and that he only dealed within the building, he was tolerated. But he still had enemies. Once, when the person he bought bulk from was coming to deliver, he was ambushed and Karol gave the strangest picture of what he ensued. Nick is not a particularly large man, and supposedly they quite literally grabbed his legs and swung him around like a toy, smashing him into this and that to get him to give them the goods. He did not but thought from then on that Karol was in on it, to rob him. I remember one of the times i went to see Karol at this building. Kyle (crack) was there, who is such a strange and silent man. He was just there, every blunt rolled, silently joining in. Like a strange human decoration. But this day i remember a couple woman hanging out with them. They lived in the penthouse apartment. How his business partner had sex in the hot tub on the roof with one of them that night. How he seemed to know everyone he saw there. We reminisced about all of this with Kayla. Until heading to the next place, she spoke of her dating life a bit. How she went out with one guy that said within minutes of meeting that he just broke up and has zero interest in a relationship, he is looking for lovers. They had dinner. Then drinks, almost every comment of his an innuendo. A terrible experience supposedly, but why did you go out for drinks? She gave a vague answer, i just don’t go on so many dates. She soon left and me and Karol went for one last drink then headed back to his place, where he gave me his switch to borrow, which would take up way too many hours of my life over the next couple weeks.

Zelda, the experience of playing it

Saturday was a fire at my place.

Sunday soccer then chat with Jay, he spoke of how some die when they are given anesthesiology

Having COVID.

Second Sunday playing soccer after testing negative for COVID. Sitting with those older folks. Eric wolf in Brooklyn dodgers hat.

Friday saw sunny. Went to barrows pub. Pool etc.

Saturday surfing. Saw that girl from dating app.

Sunday watching premier league. Girl i slept with in December happened to be at cafe, she came up and said hi. Maybe something happens in the night

Dream about my dad. Driving towards the horseback riding spot away from city island. Him speeding. Going speedily towards the turn and crashing. Me telling him to be patient. Explaining patience through go, you wait for the opponent to make poor moves, you don’t immediately respond, you take advantage of their mistakes, you play patiently. Awoke wondering why this dream, and i thought it’s because I’m single, he in his death wants me to speed up but I preach patience, all will come together.

## May 2022

Decided to do a thing so popular nowadays that I’d been avoiding for so long. Playing video games. Borrowed the Nintendo switch from a friend, downloaded Zelda, and days disappeared into. I remember turning it on, saying to myself, I’ll stop in an hour. I’d always stop right before going to bed. Rabidly doing one thing after the next. The game gives you an open world that would take a handful of hours to go from one end to the other. So, you have this giant world that you are free to wander here and there. And that’s what you cannot help but do. I mainly went from one watchtower to watchtower, which when you climbed opened up the map you see, turning the space from blackness to visible. Everywhere are these little places called shrines that have a unique and creative challenge to overcome, increasing one’s abilities for the rest of the game. An endless variety of things to do, exploring, challenges, a storyline. I played and played every free moment until i got Covid, when i knew that if i opened it, i would do nothing else the entire time i had it.

Saturday was a fire in my yard. Met up with Kyle before the rest. We went to halyards to have a drink. Within moments he began speaking about me likely having a susceptibility for alcoholism. He goes, I’d give you a thousand dollars if you took a 3 month break. Absolutely not. What’s to say to any of this, i simply maneuver around the discussion. Ask him questions about life. He starts talking about something he’d been ‘spending a lot of time thinking about recently’. Something I’d hear him repeat a few times when we’d see each other in the future. The other day i was listening to Sam Harris, and he was talking about this idea that science can give answers to moral questions and give us definite path to well being. Then ‘on the opposite side of the spectrum but of a similar vein’, the dude that helped invent the transistor who was a proponent of eugenics. And what is eugenics, but a form of science, or rather, it was thought as a science in that time. And i believe his point is that spiritual questions cannot be answered through science, and if they are things like eugenics come to fruition. We head back, stopping at whole foods for some supplies for the night. Food and drink prep then people begin to arrive. Janice and Ryan and Jamie. The night moves without qualms. Until near the end of the night and the topic of religion gets broached by the young couple. Janice/Kyle. And they are intently speaking to one another, rather arguing with one another. Eventually, i cannot help but go i feel as if you two always do this, speak about the same thing every time, and there never appears to be a solution. Then i go back to speaking to the other two for a bit. Soon, i hear Janice going, i feel like we should stop talking about this, i feel we’re just talking in circles. He goes to the bathroom, or so we think but quickly realise that he decided to do an Irish goodbye. Annoyingly, to all of us. Janice is flustered, and obviously thinking to chase after him. But before she goes, some advice, there is little - if any - hope that these discussions you two love to have will bear fruit. I did the same with him for quite some time before realising this. So, please don’t expect this to change between the two of you. And she soon ran away. Ryan goes, I’m sure it’s purely physical btw the two of them, there is no chemistry, Jamie agrees. And, we begin talking about each other’s family history. Mine is quite unknown prior to my ancestors coming to the city - Ellis island records and the like. There is zoltan, born the same day as me on my fathers fathers side. The genes are mainly Irish and English. My mothers two uncles died in the war, her father survived the war. Jamie is Jewish, Ashkenazi, from Germany, many died in the camps. Ryan’s family is serious about their history, going out of their way here and there to collect documents. He’s mainly German. It’s late, we call it.

The main thing i remember about Sunday is after soccer drinking and Jay telling me about anaesthesia. How he has to do it to someone at the age and health that is susceptible to dying when put down. Put to sleep for surgery, possibly to never awake. A risk taken, the surgery for a serious ailment that may end their life straightaway or a gradual death. I remember heading home and talking a bit to my roommate, in his 50s and in bad shape and about to go under himself for knee surgery. I did not, but had the thought.

The next couple of days i remember taking it easy. On Wednesday i noticed a cough, itchy throat, a very mild fever developing. Was going to go out but decided to stay home, just in case. And the next day i felt worse, and it was the day my roommate came back from surgery. I helped him walk into the apartment, i picked up his drugs from the store. I brought him food and water. I remember seeing my other roommate, nick, mentioning that i feel like trash, i may have COVID. I ordered some tests from Amazon. I passed out around 5. Was feverish the entire night. Mad thoughts. Thoughts that kept on running towards no where. Just insanity. The type of thoughts and sensations that turn time into a blur. Every minute incoherent. Oh at times like this one could be run to death without rest. Life descends towards death, the rested body fights it’s way back. I slept until the following afternoon. Took off from work. The tests arrived, tested positive. Told my roommates. And it was such a strange time for this to happen. My roommate, bedridden, just back from his surgery and it’s risky for me to do anything for him but i still have to help him. He keeps his door closed and yells out with emphatic thanks for things like an earl grey tea, water, bringing down some dishes - our rooms are on the second floor, the kitchen is on the first. The first few days i spend almost all of my time in my room. I have an appetite from the beginning and order food to be delivered from whole foods. Chicken soup, fruit, broth, ginger drinks, coconut water. And read basically the entire wolf hall series, each book averaging around 700 pages. I watch shows, well rather, start shows then give up on them. I watch wolf hall after finishing the first two books, give up on the last midway through and simply read the Wikipedia article about the protagonist, Thomas Cromwell, which tells me what happens at the end - he gets beheaded. Days seem to blend together, one after the next - all I’m doing is reading, working, watching this and that until the second weekend i head back into the world. A long walk and sitting at a cafe to continue to write. And after about 10 days i test negative and head to play soccer the same day.

That night back in reality i head to the bar for the first time. And the regular crew heads out after a short time but i stay to watch the rangers playoff game with a few folks that have been going to this bar since it opened, 25 years ago. I remember getting a scent of what they smelled like when returning indoors, and what i smelled was ‘greens’ - weak weed often grown organically. And started chatting with these guys. All of which are rangers fans so that there was that commonality of excitement whenever something went their way. I went outside with one of the guys there and he told me a bit about how he used to be a cop on Florida for a number of years. How he and this guy are both brooklynites and have known each other forever. I told him of a dream i had the previous night. About my dead dad. We were driving towards a horseback riding place in Pelham bay park that we used to constantly drive by when i went to elementary school in city island. In the dream, he was speeding. Towards a tight turn where he crashed. I was telling him to be patient. Explaining patience through an analogy of playing the game go - you wait for the opponent to make poor moves which you don’t respond to, rather, you take advantage of their mistake by playing the move that will give you the best chance to win. I told the man at the bar - why this dream, and i thought it’s because I’m single, he in his death wants me to speed up but I preach patience, all will come together. We go back inside and the rangers win. I head home, a late and strange night, my first night out in weeks.

The following Friday i saw sunny for the first time in a long while. She’d been traveling for sometime - Florida, North Carolina, Philadelphia, Portland. And this appears to be her first weekend back. We wandered here and there in the west village, not sure where to go, everywhere seemed to require a reservation. But, i noticed where we were wandering to, and that my favorite bar in the area was right there - barrows pub. A sports bar with a pool table and so many locals. A true neighborhood spot. So unlike what was mostly around here, people were normal here - not bourgeois and pretentious. There’s something about places like this. A sense that you will see the people you see tonight again. There’s a connection in time, an experience that is not renewed each time you come to a place but builds upon itself. A place that seeps in ritual. We decided to play pool and what seems to be the normal pattern happened, we luckily win the first game. Losing after. We begin being more touchy, and one cannot help but love to be touched when it’s safe and caring. It had been some time since I’ve had a woman to touch and excitement was boiling over. We went outside, getting ready to go. And I’m trying to convince her to come back to Brooklyn or let me go back to where she’s staying in jersey. But meetings in the morning for her and where she’s staying is her ‘uncles’ home. In the sense of a man that treats her like family, who is a family friend, but is not biologically an uncle. And i cannot stay there - not because he is there but as if i do and the gossiping neighbours see me the windfall will be horrid. Her parents will find out, i will have to speak with them, they will see a part of her they didn’t know existed. And back to the space we are in, outside the bar, sitting on a rock in front of a park closed for the night. We are considering climbing over the fence but we do not. We sit and kiss and touch one another everywhere. We say goodbye, next week we say.

The next day went surfing in the rockaways for the first time in around 6 months. The water was finally bearable and the waves were luckily good. Remember chatting a bit with the owners and they’re in a great mood, because there is finally business again, because even though the winter is usually less busy because of how cold the water gets, the waves were also shit. And off i went and it was great, the crowds have not yet hit and the waves were consistent. And what seems to be a pattern in my life, a woman I’ve talked to from a dating app was coincidentally there. I stayed out for many hours, immersed in this experience i hadn’t had for so long. On the way back home, i sat on the train facing this dude with joint roach scraps in front of him. After a short wait he pulls out a pouch full of roaches and begins putting bit by bit into a paper. Dropping the scraps onto the floor. This scraggly looking man, small with odd facial hair grown all about. I cannot help but wonder if something went wrong, there was a sense of deprivation and sadness within him. But, i still got up to escape having to smell this nasty joint being smoked directly in front of me. Where i escaped was also a vibe. There were cool looking kids with trick scooters. A bit older cool kids playing trap music with tattoos all over them. All these kids with flashy long hair, that appeared to be their main badge of coolness. The tattoo kids had a leader with Kieth haring tattoos all over. They didn’t speak but if they did it appeared to solely be to do some form of ritualistic cool person movement mixed with words. The scooter kids had a couple leaders - two long straight and flowing haired boys with the right style and that perpetual look in the eyes of nonchalance. There was a bit of chatting going on here. What was memorable was the bullying. A larger boy, big bones and weight spoke of something that interested him to the two. And one of the leaders kept looking at him and made a hand sign to the boy speaking - turning the hand into a mouth that opened and closed and saying talky talky with a hostile and condescending look. The strange nature of boys, the strange psychology. The where and how and why of what makes one belong and the confusion that brings us to where we do not belong. The train ride ended. I stopped at trader joes on my way back, whole foods before winding down for a lazy Saturday night.

Sunday watching premier league. Girl i slept with in December happened to be at cafe, she came up and said hi. Maybe something happens in the night.

Monday hung out with Nick to celebrate his graduation. He was telling me about his past. When he got back tried acting school, realised it was quite a scam. Took this and the other class before deciding to stick with art. All this while in Kentucky. About his father and how he is white, German. Mother is Native American. Father is settled in the country. A huge trump supporter, stereotypical rural American family. Growing closer with him as he mainly lived with his mother. His mother had a boyfriend for a good while.

The next day i saw kyle, first time in a long while just the two of us hung out. He came to get a COVID test i had at the apartment. I remember us sitting there and he does this thing he frequently does. At this time, I’m sitting on a recliner while he’s on the floor. He asks questions like - how is life, and hat is important to you right now, are you happy. Very vague and confusing and slightly surprising questions that are barely connected to anything said before. He says questions like this are meant to be answered however one feels. And then, he goes to the ‘idea he’s been thinking a lot about’, which is the same thing he mentioned to me a few weeks prior - the conflict between science and morality but in his long winded and hard to see the connection way of speaking. We do this and that after, dinner and a beer. I ask him what it is he is doing this week as he is not working - on a vacation where all he’s doing is staying home. He gives a vague answer, which he tends to do when lying, when many tend to do, it’s easier to not give an answer than to make up one. And i know what he’s really doing, practicing for interviews as he’s hoping to leave the job we’re at for one where he gets a fatter paycheck.

The next day was more of him, but with Julia - another coworker. It was also a cat date, i brought Bella to her place - to meet Luda. Julia had a great place, she’d only been there for around a year and already the place felt put together, like a home. One can tell that she’s there as much as she can. The first hour or so sporadically after almost all of the time went to the cats, looking at them and feeling the emotions flowing out of them. This is the first time that Bella has met another cat since we found her on the street when she was a few months old. They’d constantly be staring at each other from a short distance. Bella would be hiding at times and we would have to score the house to find her. Then we’d go back to paying attention to each other. There was a certain fellow feeling, a certain comfort though this is the third time I’ve met julia. She had an aquarium with many exotic little shrimps, blue and red and multicolored little guys. Looking at it, one felt calm and at a certain peace. And here, a continual stream of consumption - beers and wine and cigs and make your own cocktail with this anise tasting Turkish liquor and weed and pizza. We sit on her porch, we sit on her stoop, we sit on her dining room table. She takes out these origami-like handicrafts and i try and fail to make one, it’s an ordeal, she tries and gives up. But she’s happy about the one she makes and goes - this is the best decoration in this apartment, a little flair ball made of colored paper and a string. Kyles been sitting there, mute - stoned and mute. Weed makes me chatty, neurotic - pulls out of me all the little ‘deep’ thoughts i built up in recent memory. She put on tv, music video time. And she mentions this concept I’ve heard here and there over - a go to karaoke song. Which may have planted the seed of my Friday night, when i went to karaoke. I don’t have one, I’ll learn it’s probably right to. A last cigarette, and we find Bella - but she doesn’t want to go, so i have to force her into the cage. We take a cab back to my place and i notice that the Sikh driver has a phrase in written on the partition in front of me. GOD WIN. So i say, what do you mean by this? And he lit up, he loves it when people ask him about this. This man has that occasionally witnessed personality quite distinct to foreigners - childlike enthusiasm and a simple, pure heart but the distinct quality is the voice, sweet, kind, soft, ethnic. What’s it mean? Well you know we always trying to do this and that! Like dreams and goals, hopes and ambitions? I say. Yes! But god always win, nobody beat god, he always win. In my religion, we believe this. Hmm, i think out loud, but how do you practice this - like in Christianity you go to church, in Islam you pray several times a day. Oh, it’s similar to muslim, but we pray in a different way. And we get back and he goes, thank you for the talk, remember god always win!

Saw sunny the day after, met her in Brooklyn heights, to go to a karaoke and pool bar over there - monteros. Once you enter the door, the first person you see is the owner - montero, to check your id. Behind the bar is his wife, both presumably in their 70s. And it’s such an odd experience waiting for a drink, unlike so many bars where there is this urgency, this speed to get a drink for someone - as you’d expect a 70 year old woman to, she moves extremely slowly. But, this somehow contributes to the experience. You’re there waiting at the bar not for one but 5 or 10 minutes, you become a strange part of the scene. And this place has a character - old objects here and there - old tvs, old jukebox, old walls and floors and ceilings and chairs, is that a phone booth?, old pool table, old everywhere. But it fits and within an hour of being here you see that so many others see it, the place fills up. I order a Guinness, everything is in bottles and cans - no drafts - and only the guiness gets poured into a glass, so to me, this is a win. We play pool. It’s a little room in the back of the place but still very much a part of the rest of the bar with a large window in and a doorway with no door, and in here is a mood. There’s a group that look to always be here. And over time the room fills up with people sitting everywhere around the table, watching with anticipation each game. On and off you’d hear cheers and clapping reverberating out. We played a few games, and i somehow hit shot after shot my first game, miraculously winning by hitting the 8 in with a bank shot. But the next game a man that presumably had been playing endless hours for years shows up to play us and gets every ball in before i get a single turn. This place is not just a vibe and pool but there’s a 50 or so year old woman sitting in the midst who is the karaoke dj. She has her old software and old screens with the words to read and old microphones and you pick your song by writing it on a card, handing it to her. We pick ‘take me home, country roads’, and it goes… awkwardly. Here you’re singing is central to the vibe. You’re in the middle of the bar, the central space and you are the main sound heard - so if you are bad - everyone notices. So, it going awkward caused a bit of dread. But still, we decided to do another song. You have to buy a drink to get a karaoke card to fill out so i went up to get another drink. And, this time the bar is full and right in front of me is a man ordering shots. Shots of makers mark - there is no open bottle. Makers mark has wax around its top, so here i am trying my best to practice patience and create a sense of comfort while she extremely slowly opens the bottle and pours the shots, finally getting to me. I bring the drinks back to sunny, where we are standing near the karaoke spot, stuffed in a little nook. And how much i wished at this time to have a go-to karaoke song because here i am, in a place I so much do not want to look at my phone, staring at it trying so hard to find a song. I pick brown eyed girl which is once again, a failure. In extreme juxtaposition to others here. So many here obviously karaoke aficionados, their song comes on and it’s a show, every note hit, every beat and rhythm corresponding with a flourish. It’s a show, plain and simple. Showmanship, a well rehearsed performance. And I’m going up doing songs i never sang in karaoke before, why would i not fail? Sunny goes up soon to sing a song that everyone knows - if i ain’t got you by Alicia keys. She smartly recruits one of these karaoke experts to sing with her, and it’s a hit. This is the perfect conclusion to call it so we head out. And I’m trying to figure out her plan for the rest of the night - if she is going home or coming with me - and she says, why don’t you just say it? Come back with me. Ok. So we head back, to walk the 30 or so minutes back to my place. We stop near this bookstore that has an instagram like wall with the words ‘books are magic’ so i take a pic and there she is now, a photo on my phone. We get to my place, smoke a cig, up to the room and the most vivid of experiences but the one that can barely be explicated in details. And we get ready for bed, go to sleep.

We woke up the next morning and did the deed once again, it’s always - for whatever reason - so much better in the morning. She’s shy and avoidant of being seen by roommates. I make a simple breakfast and some coffee. We head to the cafe i frequently go to to write, kos. We sit and soon she wants to hear something i wrote. And now I’m shy and say, why not sit outside. And we go but, of course, right after a woman sits right next to us and is basically facing us. She’s bound to hear everything i say. But there’s no way around it now. So i read my story, i cannot remember which one it was. Then it’s almost time to do what I’m doing next, watch the champions league final btw Real Madrid and Liverpool. I have to go to this, someone literally photoshopped my face onto salah as the advert for this event among the 50 or so folks in our soccer group. I get to the bar and eventually the game starts. The game is very defensive, rarely are there chances for either team. And the group there is mainly ambivalent as to who wins. Can’t really remember any conversations that i had until the game was over and a few of us remained. There was a the Ukrainian Tottenham fan, who is friends with this character in the group that is a supporter of Russia, of Putin during this war that is happening right now - even though he grew up in, i believe, Michigan of Ukrainian ancestry - Greg. This Tottenham fan spoke of how he and Greg have been friends for a very long time. How Greg said this war was imminent, that he predicted much of what Russia has done in recent years. This man, Greg, who i remember during the ski trip when he slept in the room next to mine, how he would be listening to some obscure Russian YouTube videos next door which i now know to be videos of pro Russian small scale streamers - reminiscent of right wing YouTubers and Qanon conspiracy theorists that litter the web. He spoke of how Russia winning was inevitable. Russia has the better war machines, the much more disciplined army. Ukraines soldiers are full of untrained civilians, there are countless instances of them leaving their post - for why would they not? They are not trained for this, they realise that their chances of winning are minuscule - why fight when you see that you will most likely lose in the end? This is the 21st century, the age of the internet, the age of seeing yourself as a global citizen - what is patriotism when you have learned that every political system is broken in its own right? How different will the constraints be when this country takes over - likely not all that different? Why die when you can live not very differently than you did before this nation came and said you will no longer be a sovereign state? This man left then it was just me, Jay, and avi. Avi telling one story after the next. He spoke of his time in fat camp when he was young, his parents literally sent him to fat camp. How, while there, he had 6 girlfriends over the span of 3 months. And, his nickname was ‘fat camp pimp’ - unforgettable. Soon, me and Jay went out, he to his home and i to canal bar to watch the rangers game. Here was the perfect place to watch the game. Surrounding me was a group of huge fans, eyes and spirits glued to the events on the screen. An older woman, who went to the rangers games at msg all the time when young. A bar owner who simply roots for all ny teams as when they win business is way better. There was this funny looking guy with a high pitched voice from LA who wants to live for some time in the city and for some time back in LA throughout the year. He decided to name drop and goes i direct music videos and just worked with Bieber, oh that’s a thing i said. And there was this man sitting next to me who used to be a regular at this bar for a number of years from upstate and is trying, rn, to move back to Brooklyn as he is currently living upstate. And the bartender, this buxom but very nerdy looking woman, who is not much of a sports fan but recently went to a rangers game with her cousin. And her cousin wanted to get her first tattoo after the game so they got matching ones which were simply the name ‘Igor’ - Igor being the ny rangers goalie that played this season like one of the best players in the league. The rangers won, i headed home.

The next day i went to the beach by myself to go surfing. While changing i chatted with a man from Ecuador and told him about my time in Montanita, Ecuador. A place I still frequently dream about. But in these dreams I’m always near it but not in it. I visit a place near it but never return to where i lived, spend time with those i knew. Always there but not there. The hobby i learned there is still with me, and that is what brings me - over and over - back to the rockaways. After getting the board, went out into the crowded surf. Within minutes, being overzealous to catch a wave, i did so without looking around me. And, i collided with another surfer, hitting him in the calf. I instantly apologized, and tried to explain myself a bit but all i got in return was fury and anger which is reasonable seeing as i presumably bruised him. And this ruined my experience for the next half or so hour because whenever I’d see him I’d see him gossiping with this friend or another and i felt like crap. The waves were so crowded here as well, so i soon got out and went to the other side of the rock pier where there were a much less surfers. Here things were good, peaceful and easy. The Ecuadorian surfer soon showed up and we chatted a bit more, mainly about how much better things were on this side. But he soon left and a beauty of a woman kept looking at me so i began chatting with her. She’s Turkish but lives in Manhattan. Learning to surf and she was quite exceptional for one learning, catching white wave after white wave standing up. I’d been in for hours at this time so figured it was time to head back. I said goodbye to her. And was soon headed back home. Exhausted and starved and nauseous, i headed back. The whole train ride back, with my eyes closed. I went directly to a ramen space near my place. While there i noticed a familiar face, this dude with a big smile, a beard and tattoos, a metal dudes sense of style. He came up to me and said my name, i couldn’t remember his. But we worked together for some time at xian famous foods. At that place they constantly moved you from one location to the next so from time to time we’d work together. We exchanged numbers. I get home and nap til i have to head into the city. I show up late to my friends bday thing but feel refreshed and alive after the ramen and nap. The table has 10 or so folks, drinking beer and eating pizza. Everyone was expected except Steve and his gf - a woman I’d never seen. She was super cute and they seemed happy together - great for him. At the table just simple convo. Joke after joke. Until we headed out to the next spot. Pool and ping pong at cellar dog. For some reason the bartender always catches my eye at this place. It’s how cute she is, how we have a similar way of flirting, how on point she is. We finished up here and headed to a spot called big bar, a funky little spot with a dj playing odd tunes with no one dancing, there is no where to dance in this bar. A few of us go outside to play the oddest of games, where a group of you smokes a cigarette and tries to get the ash to stay a part of the cigarette. So, just about the entire time it’s held vertically and passed in the circle. We decided that whoever loses has to, without saying anything, give the birthday boy a smooch on the head. Of course, i lost and that’s what happened, i went to whisper something to him and then gave him a kiss on the head. We decided to go to one final spot. International bar. Here we had a big high table and decided to play some games. Started with truth or dare, chosen by spinning a thing of lipstick. Simple truths but funny dares. Make a tie out of toilet paper, a crown out of toilet paper. Stand in the middle of the bar and screech then do an odd dance for a few seconds. Ridiculous dares. We switched to another game, paranoia. Where you go around in a circle and the person next to you whispers a who question, and you have to point to someone at the table who you think most fits. After choosing them you play rock, paper, scissors with them and if they win you tell them the question, if you win you do not have to say anything. In this game there are plenty of vicious questions, which rarely, do you want the one you point to know that you chose them. A game you have to play with people you are comfortable with or one can expect animosity, anger, and confusion that you are chosen. We go on with this for so many hours, until it’s time to go. Outside, while figuring out how each will get home, strangers keep popping up to chat. A drunk dude comes up asking if we can open the McDonald’s, and I’m joking with him even though he’s obviously a drunken asshole. And more joking with this and that person before i hop on a bike home.

This Tuesday i saw Allan for the first time during his visit. He’s here for 3 or so weeks to do practice and perform a ballet with a company he’s worked with for many years. A small scale ballet company. We met up at the place he’s staying on Atlantic Avenue right across the street from Barclays center. I showed up there and simply took it in. These are wealthy friends of his, they used to own this massive apartment in a tall building in TriBeCa. A literal home. Huge living room, kitchen, recreational rooms, a bunch of bedrooms. Full of nice stuff, architectural furniture and huge windows and cultured artistic pieces. But this place quite a bit smaller, the kids have moved out and they’re in retirement mode. Bought a place in the Hamptons and rent this place to be close to their children and grandchildren. And, decidedly, they chose this place for the view. On each floor of this 10 or so story doorman apartment building, there are a dozen or so apartments but this is the one of the dozen that has the ideal scenic overlook of the Atlantic and dean cross street. And it’s an intense, active, extremely lively, endlessly moving view. I took it in, we ate and caught up. This is my life now and this is mine. Simple chatter before we head out to see some art in the city. My roommate just finished his masters at a small school near Washington square. We showed up a bit later, called him up when we got there and it was perfect - he says he was about to leave, caught him right before. Had no expectations but the school truly had a lot of character, immediately noticeable when entering. It felt heady, old, open, high ceilings. He brought us to his exhibit and it was genuinely impressive. The quality of the work and the location. His art was kept in this area with extremely high ceilings and the piping/vents visible and looming. It felt and after i saw the rest of the students art - i realised it was - the best room to display art. But also the place for the most intense art to fit the mood. The art had to be impressive, it had to be expansive, it had to be raw. Looking at his art one sees that is not an acquired taste, it tastes good for everyone. He stopped us in front of the last painting he did, this massive work influenced by the book I’ve seen him reading for months - a Herodotus textbook. The painting was centered around a leader - hydarnes the younger - of the immortals, this legendary persian army unit. And around him, his troops and a vivid colorful skyline. I loved this about him, this fact that he’d been reading this book without end to feel this image, to inspire. One feels that about all his art, it’s all inherently personal, taken straight out of his life experiences and that he immersed himself in these experiences when working on a piece. He showed another from an influential friend during his time working in chipotle and i remember when he would talk about how important those friendships were in his life. A piece inspired by his time in the marines - a story he heard of a marine commander with a reporter at the beginning of the US occupation of afganhistan, how they decided to drive through a hostile town and the entire way through were being fired at with gunshots repeatedly striking the car but the marines were composed, as if nothing was amiss. The painting is through the reporters perspective. He showed a piece dedicated to his uncle, who died several years ago - a collage of memories. A Christmas memory, a sitting together on the stoop memory, hanging out, his dog, and personal objects. He had several self portraits, one where he looked skeletal and the other simpler/less out there. And much more. He showed us around the rest of his fellow graduates work. It was all quite different than his own. Plainer, less interesting, less talented - i had no idea that he was definitively the talent here - and so glad to have realised this. He showed us around the rest of the school. Through seeming labyrinths in the lower floors, here and there. Everything seemingly connected, the rooms with the boilers and the lockers for the students and odd passageways to god knows what. He brought us up to his studio on the third floor. His, basically in the most central location. He said how after the first year and one can request a studio room he immediately thought to select this one without ever visiting it. And it’s the perfect spot, with a fire escape right out the window and a pretty view of inner courtyards on the block. He said the studio was the same of a famous artist - Philip guston. Eventually we headed up the fire escape to the roof to chat a bit more up there. And i brought up the idea of fear of heights. And they both had a story. Nick spoke of how, when he was in the marines, a required challenge was to climb up this multi story high structure made out of logs, with no harness. How he remembers getting to the top and had barely enough strength to get up, how his sergeant was screaming at him to hurry the f up. But he was dying inside, terrified, shaking in fear - a fall would break bones. But he sucked it up and went up. Allan spoke of his time working at la rev, a show in Las Vegas directed by the original director of Circe du soleil, Franco dragone. He was one of the main actors, and the show always started with him coming from being submerged in water to being pulled stories high solely through grasping a rope wrapped around his right forearm. How he did this countless times, fear of heights vanished quite quickly. We headed down soon after, headed to the train to go back. While waiting, Allan had another story, this time that he was oddly going home late and his unlimited metro card kept failing and eventually told him to wait 20 or so minutes to try again. He eventually decided to jump the turnstile, began strolling to the train and a group of plainclothes policeman were waiting for him. He was extremely upset, repeatedly telling them that the card wasn’t working. And they wanted to take him in. He kept saying no, calling them corrupt, saying this is insane, you can go check that my card is unlimited, aren’t you ashamed of yourselves. But they told him he has to come, and he eventually did, but not without some resistance. Arrested for hopping a turnstile because of a broken card reader. We got on the train and Allan told me about his show happening in a couple weeks that i have to go to, i said of course before departing.

## June 2022

Wed with Karol and the people, him telling me about the thing with andrew. Kayla looking pretty. Biking back on the grey citi bike the 10 miles.

Thursday was bens show. Then at the woods. Miguel’s old friend chat. That guy so very not cool. The Swiss and the Italian dude. Guys a writer. Other guys an environmental engineer. Guy outside telling his story. Had to be back to walk Dante.

Friday had folks over. Janice arrived early. Walked Dante. Dog park. Forgotten keys. Others arrived. His crazy energy. Me cranky. Everyone arrives. Play the game. Me and Jamie playing the game then talking of other things. Mentioned if she’s trying to become pregnant. Some left then more catan. Won all three games. Gossiping in the balcony.

Woke up and the cat insanity. Janice hang out and dog walk. Date kinda thing. Long walk with Dante. Lazy night.

Sunday footy then mike showed up. Went to namaste, went back and hung out - wine and chatting.

Not sure what we did Monday; believe we got ramen then hung out for a bit again.

Tuesday it was me and mike and karol and Nick hanging out. Nick talking about being a chief in the past. Karol fascinated. Smoking weed, beers, catan. Karol spoke about how his gf moving here is a serious thing.

The next day mike again. We saw everything everywhere all at once. The diner before going, a ton of jalapeños, the sad date, the kid and his dad talking about calculus. Woman at theater, strolling from the bathroom - life is not a movie, i should learn to make it more like one. Describe the movie. Walking back talking of it - scenes. Mikes favorite scene, copying the scene from 2001 a space odyssey. The moral, how it’s existed forever - focus on what’s around you, etc. He says you can find written evidence of peoples struggle with this in the story of the Gilgamesh - the old woman giving him advice, but he doesn’t follow it. We went back, took it easy.

Saw Allan and Michael on Thursday, again meeting at the place Allan is staying. Brought dante, talk about dante. We went to the roof to eat. Spoke to Michael while waiting for Allan to return and he spoke of his apartment in marble hill, how nice it is to have his own space with his wife. I said grace, ty god or what not for non temporary friendship, that allans dream comes true to live here and there, something else. Another dog came on the roof and it was playing with dante, being a bit mean to dante, teasing him by not letting him get the toy. And he was so upset, barking and disconcerting the other dogs owner, but dante is a safe pup. Michael spoke a while about his work with an organization that is working to bring about a freeer palastine, definitely more so on the Palestinian than the Jewish side. He is Jewish, fought in the army for several years. Seen a lot. He works in public schools teaching dance and the like. Was a big break dancer and beat boxer when younger, now in his 40s or 50s. But spoke mainly about this new ‘job’ he is doing translating Hebrew of discussions about this subject that a filmmaker filmed and is working to make a low budget film of snippets, a kind of collage. We went back inside and watched in and of itself. This quite amazing show. After it was over we spoke of it. If it’s meaning. Michael kept saying how mine blowing it is. And pointing at specific scenes. He spoke of a friend of his that keeps trying to point out this esoteric thing after this without ever understanding how ingrained he was in it in the first place. The moon full equals people bursting with energy, analogous to your body being an everywhere full tide, how heating this bothered him. He spoke of working in a group with a seer. Eventually we left, and on the street Michael told me the story of what brought him to the work. A long story, the book sitting there; Allan picking it up one day even though it was in Hebrew, always searching, never read a book in his life, when he started he decided this is it. How he is getting so much more than he gives from it. I went home.

Friday. In the morning Allan stopped by and we got namaste. Spoke of the work. The sense that it must be strangely fateful to do this thing. At night, at the place again. First went to this green place specialized in octopus. We played catan again. A long game but I’m barely emotionally invested anymore when hanging here. It’s just a relaxed hang out mixed with old habits that we are aware of in one another and working on improving how we react and communicate. After the game i was adamant about having a not late night. We sat and chat. I remember sitting there at one point lip syncing with the jimmy kimmel late night show. Russia was the topic, so much water, all the Stalin and Lenin statues - we must take down the statues, it’s so important, switching from one news channel to the next - snippets. Improv. Eventually they go, Janice sleeps on the couch.

Next day prob coffee shop and long dante walk. Went to the ballet in the night. Allan being the main part of it. The other main dancer. I’d hear a few days later this and that. The other dancers. The kids. The music, the story. The beauty of it all, the strange pleasure of watching such a spectacle. The how of such a show to be put together. After speaking to allan with my mom and she telling him how he’s been important in my life. Me and my mom doing a long walk and eventually sitting at an Italian restaurant, has a smell at first then change spots, speak of this and that but mainly remember us chatting about life as a middle child, the anger of my brother when i was born, i mentioned my sisters birth. Strange how much harder i find it to remember things that people i know say than those i do not know. Eventually walked her back to the bus.

On Tuesday saw Allan for the last time before he left. Spoke of the work. Spoke of visiting him later in the year in la. He met Bella and loved her. We spoke of the play, he told me details of how it is run.

Wednesday a few of us played basketball. Was me and Brian and randos basically the entire time. The strange vibe of playing basketball with random folks. But how strangely it worked out. We played on the right team, won every game. We went back to my place after and played azul. Was a but annoyed by folks energy, nothing particularly memorable.

Soccer on thurs. Then drinks. Kyle showed up and chat with Paul. Spoke of his mutual fund. A strange form of one. His company owns land here and there and focused on sustainable agriculture with this land. Land in Australia for grass fed meat. Land in Ireland for sustainable forestry. Organic farming in the us, in the Midwest and northeast. Talks of expanding to Portugal to grow olives. How Kyle’s grandfather owns hundreds of acres in Virginia. How amazing his business is doing rn. How it’s a great time to be a farmer. How we’re on our way to a recession.

Next day was with sunny. Met then xian and crying and me trying to make sense of it. My reputation. Why didn’t you consult me? Me saying I’m naive. I’m getting yelled at over and over. Tears and more tears. Me confused. Eventually kicked out simply by them beginning to clean up the place. And we begin walking and she thinks we hit some kind of compromise that i have to not say much more about the relationship with others, i just wanted her to stop crying but didn’t really say much out of being naive and that i am sorry for this. But i never understood what i was saying sorry about that. And she did. I kept becoming confused why she is upset when she keeps telling me that she’s upset that I’m hiding her but she also wants me to not tell anyone. This makes no sense to me. Walking through the park and sitting and she said that thing she always said. I tell her what she means to me. things are fine. I keep walking and are all touchy and friendly. The boathouse, cig, massage. I talk about possibly joining gurdjieff thing, explain it. We get out of the park. Ice cream and she gets the wrong one and of course has to go back to remedy this. We head to dive bar. The fish tank, the fish staring. Connect 4. We speak of things being good. She keeps hugging me, she keeps leaning into my crotch. She peaks at my texts when i open my phone. Sees Janice. I spoke earlier that i barely text people and call people. So she wonders what i said to her. And she is adamant about knowing. I show her and it kills her and she begins to cry again. Then we are outside, she’s on a stoop. Crying and the reputation thing once again. And sorry and I’m a bit argumentative and tell her it cannot be helped, i tell people about my relationships. And eventually she says it must end, i stay for a bit then we depart.

The next day, got up early. Went to brightons, tony didn’t show up, went right back. After getting home, hopped on a bike to ride up 12th street to see when the block party show was. Ran into Andy, told me that it would be in a few hours and left, headed to that cute diner - little purity. Remember the woman working there and her odd presumably bf sitting at the counter waiting for him. That very Brooklyn manager. Headed back home bc it was oddly cold and i was underdressed. Went back to the block party, and they were about to play - Andy and Dave specifically. They played mainly covers, high and dry by Radiohead, Beatles songs, this and that. Dave soon left to see his new kitten. And me and Andy and April and all these folks i never met, in an intimate block party. That adorable little girl, clever and funny. Pete and Circe showed up with her mother and cousin with the newborn in the stroller. Barely a month old. The mothers mother constantly concerned of the baby’s warmth. Constantly calling the baby little Peter. Pete with his look, that so friendly look. Back to the block thing. The thing that others would of showed up to but i strangely found a way to be there at the right place and time. Hoola hooping, more music. They kept playing Wilco songs. The musician. Just the feeling there. Headed to the gate eventually. And, curiously, a big group was there with the baby there once again. Billy and his gf and Courtade and Jay and Barbara and Miguel. So again hi to the baby and chats and telling Sam to come. As always, a strange chat with Billy. Then in the bar and drinks and a shot. Ate some tava then we headed to monteros. Packed. Jay and Miguel amazing. Jay a natural showman, in refrains constantly saying things to get the everyone excited. Drinking estrellas. They sang Backstreet Boys, tiny dancer, a Disney song, despacito. Ashley sang Taylor swift. The whole bar wild and lively and everyone getting so much into every song. I sang con te partiro. Jerry chant. Hindsight. Left eventually in plans to head to the beach the next day.

Beach the day after. Again Tony didn’t show. Went to this restaurant. This conversation happening btw middle age folks, talking about their childrens lack of study habits. Not doing well in school, high achieving mother. Name dropping this and that school she went to. Dominating the conversation. Then marriages, my sister never married, i married young - yada yada. The other men eating alone in the place, Russians or similar. Waiters dressed up. Screen with images. The food. Headed back. Rested before soccer. Played then drank. Penty and Andy speaking of improv. The dogs. Cata fashionable and her fashionable friend. Headed home.

Monday cafes. Cafe regular, cute little spot. Interesting procession of people in and out. Describe the place. Other normal cafe. Felt off. Went home and napped and Brian texted to play basketball. Showed up and played just the two of us. Played well but started feeling like hell. Ramen and Lou Lou showed up. Told about sunny. And she spoke of therapy, as I mentioned sunny mentioning it. She said this thing about how Brian should pay for her therapy because it was his fault. And they did this thing they always do where they argue for minutes on end about god knows what. I went home and slept for so many hours the next day. Was feverish the whole night. Had this dream where there was this game that Jay and Miguel convinced me to play, the real life game of war - literal war but in the dream it felt like everyone was there in drunken revelry. I saw someone get killed and said, i have to go. And left and wandered all these corridors trying to hide from those trying to reprimand me for leaving this game of war.

Wednesday i saw Janice. We went to wangs and sat and told her the sunny story.

Next day mike was sleeping over. He showed up and we headed to pig beach. Joking about how we were on the table of misplaced folks, right in the middle of it. And he said he wanted to seriously better understand coding. So i described to him things that i have done. Described Jenkins. Described the pr deployer, basics of websites, basics of working as a dev, working on a team. He keeps going on about the people around us. We head out to canal bar. Sit back there and he opens up a bit more about previous relationships, how the last few tore him apart, how the woman were mean to him when the relationship ended. How he was suicidal, how i felt as if there was progress. How i feel he’s heading in the right direction. We left, peaked at lucky 13 and didn’t go. Went back to my place, set up his bed and we played a few games of azul; and he beat me really quite embarrassingly. He left pretty early the next day.

The next day went to xian out of a sense of nostalgia after last week. Then tjs. Then met up with Janice round 8 at oceans 8. Ping pong where she beat me over and over. She spoke a bit about therapy. How expensive it is and how all she’s doing is talking right now and he has not yet given her advice. We headed to get yogurt at this spot she loves and we walked and walked, me with my stories and questions, her with her harmonious conversation. Passed by this church, st Augustine that i remembered being particularly beautiful. And then we headed to see Brian and Lou Lou at this bar in crown heights. Fancy cocktails and pool. The drunk trying to chat up Janice and Lou Lou. The old black dude we played against. Sunglasses. Went to another spot. Played this game where we go around kissing one another. Street food. That portrait of Eric adams with a giant forehead. To Lou Lou’s. The excrement in the toilet. Some games. Coke and monopoly. That enormous cat. Left and while trying to go Lou Lou and Brian arguing about something trivial about monopoly. Biked home, was almost 6am when i got back.

Next day woke up after a few hours of sleep because this time tony was actually going to be at Brighton beach. Train and remember that strange woman trying to talk to everyone on the train but focused on saying positive things. You’re so beautiful she said to this woman from Ukraine. Got there and waited in front of a food market called Tashkent right off the train. Waited for a bit for tony. Remembered this huge headed and serious looking Uzbek man who was the security guard. Inside the place was bustling with so many choices of foods to pack and take to go. So much of it looked amazing and cheap. We got food and headed to the beach. Once we got there, he goes the Brazilians are here, let’s hang with them. And he’s friends with them. We set up there and his main friend there is Laura, believe that was her name, this happy au pair that’s been in the city for almost 20 years. But the group was an interesting Brazilian procession. We sat near her. Went for a dip, napped. And this man named mark showed up. Spoke to him and he saw my tattoo, saying it’s some kind of sacred symbol - the mandala. He spoke of current events, kids being damaged bc of pronoun things, mask wearing, abortion. His time when young when 95 percent of the time during this doing drugs and hanging out times sex was involved. How he’s so glad of abortion at that time bc if it wasn’t there for him then he would have been a terrible father to a child. This man does long distance swimming along Brighton beach, hours at once. Every day in the morning. How the water is different this year. A different current is going along the coast then normal. Or rather the Gulf Stream that usually brings warmer water to the northeast coast has grown weaker making the water colder than it’s been for years. He spoke of how he cannot remember the water being this cold. He told a story of swimming and when he got out he was shivering intensely. And after another friend showed up. She’s American and her husband is Uzbek. And more chatting for a bit before we head back into the water. And the American woman points out her husband and he’s literally simulating serving in tennis. Then we look away for a bit and he’s doing strange footwork with full intensity. She mentions how a tennis teacher told him his footwork was off when they were in Florida. This complete lacking of self consciousness behaviour. Looking around the beach you see other variants of this, this is a behaviour seemingly normal in this place. We get out and eat and head towards this man but run into a few others of Tony’s friends. This aged man and his presumably younger partner but not by all that many years. Both happy and friendly. The younger man was very intentional in discussion. Spoke of the gay parade; how the most interesting thing was watching the folks who clean up the next day, it’s such a messy parade. The younger one sees his mom often in Seattle. They asked about me and spoke a bit but mainly listened. Eventually we headed out with Laura. And remember this odd pigeon drama. A man about to do the dirty but another came at the instance it was about to happen scaring him away. How this other went to a more hidden spot while the original suitor sat near seemingly jealous and upset. Took the train. And spoke to Laura. From Rio de Janeiro. Been here 20 or so years. No family here. Hasn’t been back to Brazil since her brother died in 2018. Rarely revisits. Works with a family, taking care of a small child. But she’s happy to be here, she has great friends she says, happy living a simple quite lonely life. Tony is only here for a couple more weeks. Living at an apartment he designed years back, a constant in his life - designing for a rich client and being able to stay at this place when they’re not there. An amazing apartment overlooking gramercy park. He’s about to head to Colorado to work on a new place for another client. And he’s mainly content with seminary, which he’s doing in Louisville. A different way of life, a challenge being back in school after only getting a ged. Surrounded by kids much younger than he. He may stick it out but the sense is he may not. Rest of the night i relaxed.

Mainly remember talking to aleks gf and alek. She told me about her friend that had surgery to remove cancer. How she is now in Maine working at a cafe. Taking a break from her job as an attorney. How they are travelling to Norway to visit his family. How his father is just like him but 10x more extreme.

Tuesday was with karol. Karol and Kayla at first. Went to this Jake’s pickles spot in the uws. Told sunny story. Kayla kept giving some kinda advice. Stuff like you need to be more intentional about setting expectations. Karol spoke of looking for a place for him and his gf, how difficult it is to find the right place, how nit picky she is, how she expects things to be nice and comfortable and how expensive it is to find a good spot in this city for a reasonable price. I remember speaking of those I’ve been in love with. Roxanne and yunan and that’s about it. Kayla asking why i don’t message yunan. And me saying no absolutely not, i need things to be serendipitous. And she looked as if she was taking a mental note. We walked to the train for Kayla and kept chatting about this. And the discussion went on. I remember saying something like you have an inherently fancy woman Karol. And, Kayla laughs and says, some of these things you say jerry. And i loved her for this: as I’ve heard her say this many times. And this sense that she really sees me, knows a part of me few know. She departs. We head to another bar, it’s terribly depressing, all these young kids. Karol mentions that bars round here have incredibly high rent, 50k or so each month. We start to walk up to the bar where we’d meet rob, who told karol he needs to see someone because the only people he’s really spoken to the last month or so have been fisherman and his gf. We’re 20 or so blocks away, Karol’s trying to hail a cab, we do some kinda hailing a cab game, clockwork - cars come when lights down the ave become green. Eventually get one. We get there, meet him. And it’s a journey in nostalgia. Remembering this and this person from the past. Only rob lives in city island anymore, so he sees all these folks. All these stories. Many folks were sand hogs. How most of the work ended after finishing the w train route; there’s no longer work. How Nick mastrachio would do this work. How he’d show up at an office in midtown early in the morning and they may or may not pick you. How a guy that these folks worked with had a beam fall while he was holding it, breaking every finger. How a man’s son was spraying cement on a wall, and he sprayed too much, how it caked and broke onto him - killing him. They went on about this ‘hot’ girl, one after the next, specifically someone i don’t remember named jenifer gallinari. About Nader, someone I’d occasionally hang out with at his big old mansion looking house, how he’s now a neurosurgeon. About the Cullen’s, the older in our grade and the younger a few below. How Karol used to live with them for a number of years, and how screwed up the family was. That they screwed the kids up, literally sending them to an institution, where they got filled up with drugs and whatever else was done to them. How the one in our grade, Matt, came back a shell of his former self, barely able to communicate anymore. How the younger brother, mainly remember him as being this very cute kid older girls would carress like a cute baby, how i related to this as it happened to me often when young. How the brother became a total shithead, always trying to fight people, always stirring trouble, perpetually unstable. Rob spoke of a story with him where he was about to fight someone and he went up to him, and touched his shoulder like a peacemaker and spoke kindly to him - and he calmed down, caught his breath, released his hostility. This guy Paul that was a sand hog for the longest, working all the time, but is now in the carpenters union. How he has a wife and a house and every time anyone sees him he brags about it. How many have become firemen.

Thursday. In the day was the first day back to wework in a long while and it was so perfect. I got there and sat at one of the sit/standing spots and within moments the girl i had the most feeling for way back when i used to go to this very same wework showed up and sat at the table across from me. And it was obviously an important day for her. One coworker after the next showing up as if it was the first time they’d seen each other in so long because they had a very important meeting this day. At night was soccer then sitting at the gate. First with Billy and Ashley separate from the main group. We spoke of her long trip that’s coming up. A van trip going place to place in the Colorado, New Mexico area. They mentioned the flooding happening at Yellowstone. Remember Billy expressing concern about the fact of my occasional lapses in memory, of words. This was for a current, the topic of strange weather happening and how the current along the coast atm is different than what is normally there - from the north rather than from the gulf as normal. Eventually we moved over to the rest of the group, me drinking one raspberry sour after another. Kyle talking about the go conference, how this is his focus, trying to spend as much go as he can before going. I, curiously, decide to smoke some weed, and I’m suddenly incredibly high. And the conversation then is a blur, but i do remember us talking about vacationing. My 3 ideas being, volunteering several times a day for a few weeks, cape yown and cafes and idk what else for a couple weeks, train back packing trip in Europe. And he mentions, you should be a shepherd, and i live this idea instantly. And think I’ll find a farmer, a goat farmer specifically. And the idea is planted.

The next day went to Dave’s place for a bday celebration for his gf, Jess. I show up and it’s a small group, nobody i know but the two of them. I settle in, chat a bit but they are mainly quite odd art folks. Awkward and young so lacking in confidence. Jay and cata and her cousin showed up and things got a bit more rowdy. The adorable kitten was all over the place, being showered in attention. Remember talking about goat farming bc my mind was already made from the day before. Dave mentioning how he loves goats. Chatted with Jess, peering into her past. From rural PA. Houses miles away from one another. Her dad worked on computers and moved to the town to work for the company. And the mother was from the same town she grew up in. She kept saying they’re in love, literally two folks that share mostly the same opinions or come to a concensus rapidly. How her father was married while young and had a 10 year affair with her mother before divorcing and marrying Jess’s mother. How they don’t like Dave, want her to find someone else. How they are quite thoughtless. She spoke of how, when they drove her back from PA some time back, instead of staying for a bit, seeing the place she lives, they got right back in the car and left. This misunderstanding btw her and her parents. She’s an only child. She mentioned how she could literally not walk to her friends houses, how it was literally hours of walking through woods to get to their house. How she only did it a few times as a teenager. Back into the house and Jay is telling story after story. Some more little tidbits about the farm in Columbia. Cata’s brothers son, an image of him on a horse, riding it professionally and proudly, at 2 years old. How cata had cousins all over the states, the Colombians are taking over her cousin says. I remember trying so hard to listen to what they’re saying in Spanish and realizing that i cannot understand at all, and thinking i have to start watching Spanish movies with subtitles and seriously learning the language.

On Saturday i binge watched sex education. Formulaic love story. They will be together, but when. Stereotypical love advice that is also not entirely stereotypical because they are universal problems in relationships that probably don’t have a solution.

Sunday was biking to sweet green cafe in greenpoint. Sat there for a bunch of hours. A different but good vibe, much more cool bc folk than the spot i usually write in. Then soccer then beers. Then, on my way back, Brian and Lou Lou texted to hang out. I, for some reason said yes, come over. And, we’re hanging in my room. Sitting on the floor, playing poker. We decide to smoke weed. I try to get some info out of their lives while playing. Brian didn’t have many friends in high school, and felt him to be a very lonely soul, but it’s hard to tell being that he never really speaks of his past. Lou Lou misses Vietnam, she grew up in Hanoi. We went on my fire escape, I’d lived in this room for a year and never went out onto it. Smoked weed and all these ideas that come about when stoned reverberated out of me.

Next day was the long bike ride. We started right outside of the park slope south corner. Around 10 of us began the trip towards Coney Island. Very bumpy path with lots of cracks. Mainly remember chatting with the Indian guy, what’s his name? He’s been in the city for a while, he had a start up, he’s doing well. Met his columbian gf (now wife) and there are 3 Colombian gfs in this group. He spoke of how he and his wife, the most beautiful woman in the group, are about to move to Mexico City. They plan to buy a place there and get a place in the city, to have both. Also a place by the water. Oh the ways people can think when they are wealthy. We got to Coney Island then to the hot dog eating contest. The introductions of the contestants and then introducing Joey chestnut and he’s literally being lifted on a platform with subtlety by a crane, with the crowd going nuts. Literal signs with his face on it displayed by members of the crowd, and it’s really crowded. We only saw a sliver of people gorging themselves on hot dogs. He finished by eating 63 hot dogs. Right after the Polaroid picture. After we went to this iconic pizza place, l&b spumoni’s. Pizza with cheese under the sauce. Then we headed back along the greenway, passing by the verazano bridge. We stopped right by the bridge overlook, had a beer. Chatted with andrew. He’s back in the city and will be for a while. Was in Cleveland where he worked and found a gf that he’s now seeing long distance. He’s got the job that he was planning to have when he got back. Working as a film set designer in a union. Well, he’s not yet in the union but will be. We continued on, remember chatting with texas Dave’s gf and soon to be wife. She’s from Santiago, Chile but had been living for several years in Valdivia. A place with supposed great craft beer, lots of nature tourism, natural beauty. But her home will soon be Brooklyn, marrying an American. Eventually we got to industry city and sat on the fake grass where there was a bunch of kids running around like animals. Some kid that was good at soccer playing against s kid that was obviously not, and his ego getting stroked by his brother over and over when doing something impressive. Talking a bit to Greg, when are you gonna have a fire? a bunch of little girls chasing this long hair, blue eyed boy and tackling him - he runs they chase and do it over and over again. The young girl crying. We went to the next place. And Miguel and Dave raced on citi bikes. Eventually got to strong rope and chilled there the rest of the night. Played cornhole for sometime. Miguel and Ashley’s strange behavior, both being continually mean to one another. Bickering. Chatted with melody remembering that she is still pursuing a career in graphic design and that my coworker works in her neighborhood, Carroll gardens. So thought to gather some info about her past for an intro sorta thing, which i did during the week and believe that they are now to have a coffee with another that ideally bears some fruit. It was July 4th and the fireworks began. Mentioned to Jay that this is perfect, the few is not obstructed though it is not straight on but we are not sardines, packed together watching this. Eventually we departed, a last short bike ride home.

This Thursday i avoided going out. Dave had a show but i stayed in doing i dont remember what. Think Friday was similarly a lazy day. I did the thing i love to do. Xians first, where i get the cold skin noodles and lamb burger. Absolutely addicted to this. The main allure is the mixture of flavors, this perfect combination and the main flavor being the spice which is dominated by Szechuan peppers. It’s easy there, you can be a fly in the wall, and the vibe and mood never feels overbearing. At tjs, i grab a push cart and start with the veggies and fruit, grabbing a ton of fruit bc they always have something new and different and definitively delicious. Onto the dairy and i get all sorts of juices. Prepared foods. Remember the last time i was there some dude started saying to me, i haven’t seen this in years! Holding a bag of some form of pretzel. He was so happy about this. And he goes on about how he manages a restaurant and how he’s amazed that tjs continually has something and soon after it’s gone and you don’t see it forever. And i picked out of my cart the mango shaving cream and said I’d been looking for this for weeks. I’m now using dr bronners shaving whatever it is which is so odd bc it is literally some form of slightly dense liquid that you need to catch in the palm of your hand and quickly close the container before lathering. The mango shaving cream stays on your finger, it’s not confusing to use. All the stuff at tjs, I’m always spending over 100 bucks on god knows what.

The next day, after the cafe, kyle came by to play go for the first time in so long with one another. It was a form of reconciliation, a boundary being overcome. He asked me why, i told him your passion for the game is inspiring, he studies every day, goes to a go hangout several times a week, he is getting closer and closer to these go folks, he’s going to the National go conference in Colorado in a few weeks. The man is in love with the game. And it was amazing timing to do this, he’s having a party the next week which is titled drunk go, which ofc sounds worth going to. And, tonight it’s the bday celebration for Daniel, the church friend of his i found to be the coolest of the bunch, texas Daniel - so this is what Kyle invited me to. He left, i got ready, and headed to the spot in crown heights on a citi bike. Walked in, with no idea what to expect, no sense if Daniel would even want me there - as always with him he seems to keep it cool, straight faced and unfazed. I walked to the back and it was he and kyle chatting, and his eyes lit up when he saw me with a huge jerryyyy being said and an intense pound with a hug. It’s been forever, he said, me and Ben are only ever hearing about you through kyle. So concerns alleviated. And I’m taking on what’s around me. The ppl. His friends that i never met and there’s a bunch of good looking ladies. So a little chatting in this direction and that. Naomi, a former co worker of him living in harlem, about to move right to the grand concourse in the bronx. A self proclaimed hermit, happy to live there though all her closer friends are in bk or downtown Manhattan. You get a much better apartment for a much cheaper price. She spoke glowingly of the place she just signed the lease for. An Art Deco apartment. It has a sunken living room. It’s huge and spacious and once again - cheap. She works in design, a well designed space is vital for her. Soon Nunna came, a church girl, settled deeply in the church community of kyle. And there’s a woman i loved from the church world, audrey - who i know this woman is close to. And the entire night i felt that whatever i did, whatever impression i made would be relayed to her through nunna. I felt she had an eye on me, as if she were trying to read me. We spoke, i spoke of what’s on my mind - writing, the ppl in my life, my farming vacation. She told me a bit about her, a litigation lawyer, much of the rest a blur. She was obviously fun loving, she wanted to laugh, she wanted physical touch. I spoke to Daniel’s Texas friends. What appeared to be the main group. A husband and wife and the best friend of the husband. the husband is a funny smart looking man, from El Paso. His dad owned a motorcycle dealership. Much of his friends from there are drug dealers or in jail. When he goes back he sticks out, completely out of place. Been smoking bud forever. He used to called talky talky by his friends bc when he smoked his mouth wouldn’t stop running. He’s got debilitating add, he literally had reminders on his phone to remind him to brush his teeth, make coffee in the morning as when he gets up ‘i get lost in whatever’s right in front of me’. His wife, also from Texas. They met along with Daniel and a few others there while they were living in Austin. At this time i noticed a woman named sally, and instantly felt way too much for her without having said a single word to her. It was her look and how when i stopped, as i often do, and looked around I’d catch her eye. The look in her eyes, disarming and intriguing. And she had these mannerisms, these odd ticks that showed a strange human, a strange but put together. And a certain desolation, a lack of love within, a loneliness. And then it was another eye on me to think about, but this one was there, not to be relayed to another. Another i know not what to feel about, bc she’s this odd Christian shrew of a woman but she also has this look. She has a similar desolation that reverberates out of her. And i began chatting with the best friend of the husband. A wiry dude, full of movements and expressions that are clearly cool. As if each movement was choreographed, a man that knows how to move his body. He and the husband have a ‘bromance’. Seems to be a perpetual situation that the husband and wife and he hang out, just the 3 of them. It was pretty easy to tell that the husband had the dominant voice, he simply spoke much more so in exactitudes, affirmatives while the friend was much more of an intuitive and adaptive soul, dancing through life. It’s always amazing to witness a great friendship, you witness these friends most raw and vulnerable and, most of all, unfiltered sides of their selves. We spoke a bit to some random folks, this motley crew of actors and a previous roommate of one. These folks were quite tame and dull. But the main dude spoke of his life as an actor. How it’s better here than in LA.

## July 2022

The next day went to Dave’s place for a bday celebration for his gf, Jess. I show up and it’s a small group, nobody i know but the two of them.

And she had these mannerisms, these odd ticks that showed a strange human, a strange but put together. And a certain desolation, a lack of love within, a loneliness.

And i began chatting with the best friend of the husband. A wiry dude, full of movements and expressions that are clearly cool. As if each movement was choreographed, a man that knows how to move his body. He and the husband have a ‘bromance’. Seems to be a perpetual situation that the husband and wife and he hang out, just the 3 of them. It was pretty easy to tell that the husband had the dominant voice, he simply spoke much more so in exactitudes, affirmatives while the friend was much more of an intuitive and adaptive soul, dancing through life. It’s always amazing to witness a great friendship, you witness these friends most raw and vulnerable and, most of all, unfiltered sides of their selves. We spoke a bit to some random folks, this motley crew of actors and a previous roommate of one. These folks were quite tame and dull. But the main dude spoke of his life as an actor. How it’s better here than in LA. How his last big role was as a detective based on a real life character in a discovery channel show about a murder case. The dancing man and i decided to get another drink, and the inside was painfully crowded. Requires patience to get a drink. I stumbled into Kyle and nunu again, more chatter about i don’t remember what. And out with a drink again and i think his name was Brian, brought me a margarita, but i already had one so it was given to this other odd character despite the no’s from his gf. Chubby and alcoholic looking man, jolly but seemingly quite abstracted and confused most of the time. And more chatting in this odd space. Mainly joking and jovial. The birthday man has become inebriated and ppl keep bringing him shots. Until it’s time to head to the ‘late’ place. While waiting on my check i see sally waiting as well so begin to chat with her. And it’s so odd speaking to her, it feels very patient and intense the whole way through. There’s this perpetual seeming state that she’s there but also quite far away, as if her own thoughts are quite far from her own self. So it goes on like this, slow and careful communication. She’s a Texan, she’s an art director in advertising. She decides what the ad art means, what it boils down to, what will make it bring more value to the product it’s for. And i couldn’t help but notice and continue to be enamored by the strangeness of her, this way she spoke and this strange lack of movement in her body when she spoke. And i, like a chameleon am behaving the same way. She just seemed to never lose her composure but one felt boiling out of her all these odd ticks, all these ways of being held tightly within. We paid and headed out, some are leaving, Naomi is leaving - all the way back to Harlem. It’s around 12am. And we head towards the next place, just a handful of blocks away, an interesting looking procession. i want to go but i want more to ask sally out so decide to stay to hopefully act upon it. Had no idea we’d be going to a club until we got there. A place I’d been to last around a year back with a friend i met in Ecuador, and some strangers. Now, I’m going with an old friend and a bunch of strangers. In the door, the place is obviously cool. It’s sorta the hood around the place so an interesting mixture of locals and the gentrifiers. And some old looking Italian probably drug dealers. And the group is in a space and the birthday boy is obviously drunk at this point. He’s dancing like one possessed, coolly moving here and there, in the circle we formed. His main moves is this up and down swaying of the arms with a movement of the feet forwards and backwards. And he’s bringing one person and that person is mainly Kyle to dance with him, and they’re twirling one another. People are excited. I’m doing idk what, i probably said more than 10 times to someone - how could you not dance when you’re in a club? The El Paso dude was about to head out to smoke a joint, and i joined him. We went to this backyard outdoor space, surrounded by buildings. A few hits and I’m coughing like a fool, and he mentioned that if you cough they say you get much much higher. In this space there was a door seemingly heading to no where. I opened it and behind it a sky full of clouds was painted. Someone commented that if you go in perhaps you enter another world. And i went, perhaps simply opening it has brought you into another, nothing will ever be the same. We headed back in. Daniel was seated and way out of it. Still there was dancing and people attempting to keep things going. And a few folks headed out. I approached sally, we spoke for a bit about the club, she went that the last time she was here they were playing the exact same music. And i decided to ask her, so what stumbled out of my mouth was something like - what’d you think of us doing something sometime? And she goes, it was nice meeting you, was really good meeting you with the no expressed through her body rather than her words. And that was that, painful but not unexpected. But now it felt like time to go, and everyone started to steam out. Daniel basically needed to be helped home. Again, ran into her when people were closing out, i didn’t have a check to close and was muttering something to Kyle at the counter, so let her take my space. Outside, a couple friends - Brian and Lou Lou were there, who i texted several hours before, deciding to show up right when we were on our way out. And me and Kyle gravitated to them, chatting and basically telling them we were about to go. But we gravitated to this man with huge iron grills getting a strong fire rolling. A big Jamaican man that looks like he’d been doing this forever, hundreds of times. You can sense it with the supplies, the tools, he’s an expert. And a group of people are waiting around him while he preps, anyone that comes up to him he looks at and basically says, it’s cooking. Wait. While waiting, kyle was back preaching, disdaining me and Brian and Lou Lou for smoking a cigarette. And he goes, do you want to turn out like him? All the drugs he’s done, look at him, do you really want to be that? And I’m in a joking mood so i continue this, yes, why would you ever want to be me? Incredibly strange, not sure in the slightest what love is, barely capable of feeling, basically dead while alive. We get the food, and the folks eating it seem pleased. We sit and chat a bit more, Lou Lou speaks of her work - cancer research, clinical trials about to begin. And we head out.

The next day, has to wake up way earlier than I’d like to meet this girl, Irene, at prospect park. Packed up drinks and some fruit and headed out to meet her there at 12. We met at the grand army plaza entrance, and immediately realised she was quite cute, though strangely serious. We walked to this field in the park where people everywhere bring a blanket and leisurely hang out, a wide view. We headed to the big tree on the hill overlooking the field, sat underneath it. She spoke of her dog, how she goes through this field every day in the morning to give him around an hour and half walk. Couldn’t help but say how good of a dog parent she is. We chatted for a while about all sorts of things. She’s working, so expectedly, at google and she’s very content there. From California, parents are from Taiwan. Her dog is her life. But she literally said, i wouldn’t recommend getting one, as if she’s in regret. We played this game, Jaipur. This game with cards and coins and lots of camels. Finished and spoke a bit more about life. I’m going to church later i said. And went through the explanation of all that, as I’m not a christian. And then the idea of spirituality and how she is not spiritual, whatever this means. But it seemed like a big red flag that i mentioned some form of affinity in this regard. And, i saw the google soul within her, the computer oriented soul. We spoke a bit about what this means, religion and spirituality. How she recently read this book about many variations of life after death. I spoke of how i see death, something not particularly different than life. And the book I’m reading, god 4.0. This story i remembered within it where an paleontologist visiting ancient caves with cave paintings had to go through a literal maze of tunnels to get to the inner cave. The man had to crawl through long and tight passages to find his way to the paintings. And how, in one particular cave there was a higher area, hard to get to and reach, a mystic figure over the other drawings which were almost all of depictions of animals in the lives of these ancient men. The sorcerer is what it is called. Eventually we headed out, to go our separate ways. I’d message her the day after as I wouldn’t mind seeing her again but she mentioned she didn’t see compatibility. Which was fine as i didn’t think we particularly were either, suppose i thought perhaps a kind of fling would be a possibility. A few hours later i found myself at church for the first time in many many months as i told a few people I’d go. So there i was and then listening to the preacher who was going on about an assortment of things - the main being having a place to be free in and belong. As that is his profession, working at nyu, giving community to those who arrive in this city without one - no matter who they are or their religious orientation. It ends and we go outside and i did kind of miss this, the mixture of listening and singing and spending time within a spectacle and hanging out with people you rarely see, meeting new people. The sense of community. We go to a bar in the east village. And I’m mainly chatting with Janice, as it’s as if i have words within me just for her. What’s happening in my life, what’s happening in her life, but it’s hard to get anything but short answers out of her. Being young. And at the bar there’s a big group of us and jovial conversation. Burgers and fries and beers. A new guy from the south, recently moved to the city, a music teacher trying to get to know the city better. Tony shows up with two woman and Tony’s entertaining party side is on full display. He and they are talking of karaoke songs and finding one and singing one without reservation. Conversation of languages, and Ryan is showing his language knack. And I’m mainly listening to people. Kyle and Janice are talking and he’s saying something like i want to help you, ask me questions, i can guide you - which is obviously not going to help their screwed up relationship. Eventually i go, luckily finding a silver e bike to smoothly get home on.

A couple days later a group of us decided to play some basketball at Brooklyn bridge park. A handful of us. Brian and Sam and some folks from church. This place has a ton of stuff going on, basketball and ping pong and roller blading and a small field people are kicking a ball on and pickle ball and some other stuff and the amazing view of downtown Manhattan right in front of you. Mainly folks were playing basketball or playing/waiting to play pickle ball. Nowadays, this pickle ball is really becoming a thing, the fastest growing sport in America. The basketball is intense here, especially where there’s a roof covering a handful of courts. We found ourselves on the last court, furthest out on the pier. Some teenagers were playing 2v2s and we had a a big group so we asked them if they wanted to do full court, they assented. We began playing, luckily one of us was tall and ‘plays all the time’. He carried us to win game after game. In the later games i got my cult following as so frequently happens. Doing some strange and extraordinary things. Strange shooting underhand in a moment of confusion, obviously carrying the ball. Extraordinary being bike running the full length of the court full speed to get a bucket and hustling nonstop. By the best players i got spoken as, ‘hustlin Jerry’, ‘watch out jerrys got the ball’, ‘JERRRY!!!’, ‘the one that’s in it’. And i was absolutely absorbed, my shot was shit but my defense and passes were on point. We won every game while the one dude was on our team but lost when he left. He was simply a tall dude crowding the paint who could make his own shot and smartly defend the opposing teams best player. Eventually we headed out and few of us walked over to the soccer fields nearby. Some serious looking league games were being played. An, i believe, all Italian team vs presumably post college soccer athletes. A heated game with a moment where a dude literally spit on another and the two teams were extremely close to blows. But the post college dudes were disciplined and stronger, making almost every pass perfectly on point, every touch a quality touch. Went home after they finished.

On Friday a bunch of us headed to red hook. Starting at strong rope brewery, round 10 of us. Started off by playing board games. Bananagrams and some dungeon and dragons themed easy game while the drinking began. The normal crew of Jay and miguel and Courtade and a mixture of others. The most interesting person here being Ben. Most headed out gradually while we were there. We stuck around for the sunset and to chat about this and that, predominantly jovial conversation. Miguel telling me a bit about his love life, he’s trying but it’s so hard for him. Some of us find it so hard to find any form of meaningful love within our lives. How people see life through such shallow lenses. How we probably do ourselves in so many respects. How easy it is to say or think something compared to being able to put it into practice. How the grey areas surrounding all these thoughts endlessly permeate and seep through our being - endless streams stemming from an incredibly hard to find source, endless sources perhaps. How i always get to this point, no answer and only confusion. We head to the next spot, my favorite bar near me - sunny’s. Amazingly, the same exact band they was there the last time i was here was there - headed by this woman named Erica Mancini. This amazing psychedelic folk that exudes feeling and beauty. She’s this little lady with a huge harmonica and the rest of the band is two others, one with a cello and the other with a guitar. And her voice, this vibrating rhythm, this coon that makes one feel a sense of wonder, of awe or even fear. A strange, haunting beauty. I’m drinking Narragansett’s and we’re chilling outside. I start talking to the one i forgot the name of. I’m asking him about his past. He’s from Long Island. Son of a son and daughter of immigrants from… india? But the memorable part was that the grandfather said to one of them, you must buy a house now back in the 70s. And where they lived, up near the hamptons, there were houses for 15k. The daughter of this wise grandfather bought a place, which they still have that is now worth 1.5 million dollars. Soon after Ben’s wife came, who was repeatedly mentioned as a female version of Jay. And when she came it could be seen, they both have this endless way of joking and being jovial and telling outlandish stories. Jay had a story, about his time in Bali. A girl he knew, who he didn’t suddenly meet but met during a previous trip. He and her were doing the dirty, he pulled out after finishing, and the condom broke. Is there a plan b, he instantly said. Yes she said but it’s an ordeal, you can’t just go to a pharmacy, you have to go to the hospital. And he’s drunk, and she’s drunk, and it’s Bali so there’s a scooter - which she is driving as you’d expect someone a bit wild to that drove them much of their life, swerving and turning and he’s confused out of his mind. They’re in the hospital, and shes kinda getting moralized while they’re sitting in the doctors office but he has no idea what’s going on. They get the drugs, they go. And I’m chatting about god knows what with this and that person and the next thing i know someone has found jays twitter, which is absolutely insane. For a bunch of years, he, with next to no followers was tweeting almost every day the strangest things (i need to find quotes - murse Jay). And it fit his personality perfectly. His nonchalance, his lack of self awareness, his lack of caring how people see him, his strange wisdom that only he could think of - only he could say. And how it’s there, just sitting there, this brilliant artefact of the web. We read this on and on - dying the entire time, until it was time to hop on the bikes and head home.

The next day was another Brighton beach day with Tony and celia, with Daniel showing up for a bit. A simple day for most of it, everyone hanging out and taking a short swim here and there. Simple chats. Us standing by the water talking of life, mainly they talking about a close friend that they worry about, this long email they sent recently decrying the way Donald trump is treated. How they love him but worry - why must one put so much energy into what they have so little control over. Analogous to yelling into the wind. This man, a big time swimmer, supposedly one who used to be one of the best handball players in the state - how tony has heard him speak of this before and didn’t know what to believe until someone came up to them while they were at a restaurant and gave him an emphatic pound while saying how much of a legend he is. Friends, the ways of friends. While we were standing here the feeling was so prominent that tony was feeling a sense of loss. One of his last days in this place he loves so much before he has to head back to Louisville, with a long stop in Colorado. We soon found ourselves walking down the boardwalk towards Coney Island, me and tony and Celia. Passing by the legendary handball courts, passing by the aquarium. Arriving at Coney Island, taking in the spectacle. A stop at Nathan’s. Sitting and looking out at the beach, kids playing in the muddy sand, the endless stream of people coming from all directions, the flashing lights, the amusement rides. We stop next to one, taking in the scene, the people going slowly up the cliff - the terror on their faces on the way down. Eventually the train station, this station that has murals reminiscent of what Coney Island used to be, and the way they approached this is this obscure idea to show scenes and to show individuals separate but, in a way, a part in a quite staring way. Reminding one of an odd character a part of a place but alone. A homage to the individual enjoying being out, being a part of a spectacle - perhaps. And when we swiped in to the train, this sad scene played out so quietly. A girl patiently standing while the guy she was with already swiped in - he standing on his phone - seemingly unaware of her. And he notices her, passes her the card. And they take the train separately, the sense of a date full of expectations that has failed. We head back. We depart with hugs, the knowledge that i will likely not see either of them for a long while. I head to Kyle’s, he’s having a ‘drunken go’ party. The board game go, the kind of chess of Asia. I get there and there’s a bunch of people there, strangely a pretty even ratio of men and women. And it’s a pretty good vibe. I showed up 6 hours after the rest. And people are just drinking and playing go. So i start drinking but go seems to have hit its limit for many. So chatting, and people begin to filter out but a group stays back. And we begin late night chats. Drunken and exhausted chats. I remember we chat about love and chemistry and dating. And i say, i don’t think that chemistry exists all that much - it’s predominantly the thoughts in one’s mind, how much one fits into this mold that’s already been created. And people don’t agree or if they do they argue away from it, so many believe in love - in the soulmate form of love, is believing in an exact form of chemistry so much of a deviation of such a belief? It’s a decision i always say, love is a decision. One spoke of her hinge experience, how the most interesting conversation was with a man that wanted to speak of the inherent racism in Harry Potter. How the house of slytherin is based on a kind of racial segregation - the house that is modelled through the historical structures of black American school segregation. Now she found this so interesting. How all the other chats are so boring she has with men on this dating app. One man there was head and shoulders the best player - 6 Dan which is a ranking that .00001 percent of players achieve or something along those lines, and he spoke of how he was lucky. How, when a kid he started being interested in the game through anime, and how one day his mother asked a man at a restaurant where they lived (in the flushing area so a very Asian population and hence, there were many go players) who said he’d help her son learn. And he began playing with them, or rather he showed up in this basement and simply watched for a while. He then played someone, finally, a few months later of a quite high ranking and won. And the rest was history. He had a community of go players. One of his best friends growing up became a semi pro. And now he is at the level he is. A few others left and i decided to stick around. And it was just i and this dude named Dylan, pretty new to go and the city. From Baltimore, an actor who is doing pretty well. We spoke of this girl he met through go that he has some kind of friendship and possible romantic interest in. How there’s this awkwardness to them, that he needs to address. He wants to tell her how he feels, that the friendship is more important to him then the romance. But in my mind, listening to his words, she has a romantic interest in him. So, i tell him it is likely best to ask her what she’s feeling before saying his opinion. If she has feelings, let her tell you, do not scare her away from doing so by throwing man logic and reason at her. Seeing him and kyle next to one another i can’t help but see two very similar people. Both strong personalities and big bones on skinny frames. Both confident in their words and used to being listened to, no matter the substance of their words - it’s the way they say them. Eventually i go.

On Tuesday, the first time in the office since i started the job. The first time meeting people I’ve seen in meetings for so long in person. Biked there, which was a pain being that I’m riding up an incredibly busy Manhattan avenue and one close call after the next repeatedly happens. When i get there the bike room I’m over and over trying to get into before realising that no, i cannot get in. And the building. It’s the fox building, news corp. Such an evil feeling place. There’s literally protesters outside the front doors making me feel like shit for even working here, for going through the door. I go to security to try to figure out how to get my bike in there and run into my coworker julia. I go in to try and get this resolved. But, heavy distrust, which makes sense bc this is the fox building. This is a place where some of the most hated people in America work, top right wing media executives and broadcasters and I’m this dude dressed in shorts, an old t shirt, with a bike. So the distrust makes sense. It’s an ordeal but eventually things get settled and i head in.

Tuesday was the first day back in the office. Met coworkers. Went out with Vishal and peran after. Biked home.

Thursday again at the office.

Friday surfing in the morning. In the night met katey in bed stuy.

Saturday was the night out for cata and Miguel’s bday.

The next day, after a night of so much drinking, i woke as a mess of a human. Slept and slept until i had to wake up and soon found myself chilling until soccer, getting some food, some nourishment before soccer. Went straight home after, showered and went to see this girl Emma. She wanted to meet right before heading out on a two week trip. A soccer player, so in my mind, that was the primary focus, finding another person to join our game. Specifically a woman in this male dominated crew. A kind of slow burning goal, working on it with barely any intention. I biked to where she lives, east Williamsburg, some hip spot round there. Very dimmed lights, very focused vibes. Remember this old random arcade game. But the intention was good, the feeling felt right. We sat in a dark corner of the room. Hadn’t been dating recently, so this was, or rather there was a quite a bit of trepidation on my part. And it’s the same story, the same story that keeps on repeating itself - that i have no idea how to get the past, bc it’s ingrained within me. It’s this need for the person to fit this particular look, this particular form of attraction. She could be shit to speak to, stressful to spend time with, but the way they look conquers all. And i know it’s shallow, i know that this part of myself is shit. But, it’s there and in know how to get it to go away. She was fine, but in my mind, within moments i knew it could not be romantically - i wanted and was fine to act upon things sexually. But that never goes, things never happen that way. So we chatted and she spoke with genuine intent that she wanted to play with me and my group when she comes back. I have not yet contacted her, but it’s been only round 4 weeks. But, idk where it might go, and if I’d want it to go that way, a soccer friend. We stepped out, said our goodbyes and i can’t help remembering the scene around me. This random block in east Williamsburg felt buzzing. Felt like an enclave in the, a kind of oasis, that one stumbles into. People all over the streets with intense but cool energies. A bar with music there, a few bars full of character here and there, and everywhere you looked felt as if it all blended together, one pulsating organism. I biked home.

Next day i finally said ya to go to Kyle’s go thing. Been telling him I’d go forever, and finally came up on my word. Met him at the Hungarian pastry shop. Just a simple little hang, played a few games against someone objectively better than me, lost badly the first game but probably would have won the second if we had enough time to finish. Me and kyle first headed to this spot that sells these Indian sandwiches called grannies then headed to the bar on the corner after. This depressing dive bar. Old and spacious with little tvs and a pool table. Was pretty empty while we were in there and the taps were broken, so just canned beers to drink. Pbr’s. One, two, etc. We were talking about god knows what. Something about meaning, what is meaning, what is meaningful to you. This man, a walking wannabe victor frankl. And, in front of us some odd situation. Young girls and young guys hanging out. Full of sexuality. Two are making out while playing pool. The other two are slowly loosening up to one another, gradually touching and then more bit by bit. But this girl is drunk and she’s soon in need of comfort. Young and horny. Of course there’s also old and horny. Suppose it just boils down to drunk and horny and this person will do. We finish, we head back.

Sunday hungover then soccer then met up with Emma.

On wed i saw karol and crew. Was just me and karol and mike for the first hour or so, sitting at the normal bar. The most memorable bit of conversation was about ppl having extreme kinks. Mike decided to bring it up in remembrance of this girl he used to see that wanted him to not just choke her, but choke her until she passed out, which was - to him, as it should be for most ppl - a step too far. Karol likes a big but not too much. Me, tragically, quite vanilla. This reminded me of a scene from my childhood. We were in my basement practicing this exact thing, choking one another until we passed out. Which we did quite a few times during this short time in our lives. Insane childhood things to do. We’re lucky none of us died. We were sitting at the bar, and karol gets a call from Kayla - she’s panicking - saying insane things like that andrew is dead. So, they’re at a concert in Central Park. And andrew is ‘dying’, so we have to go save andrew or what not. Karol decides we instantly need to get a cab and get there asap. And that’s what we do, a short cab ride from where we are in the uws to where they are in the ues. We get there and minutes later they stroll on up. Andrew is fine. But he did pass out in the middle of the concert surrounded by hundreds of ppl. He smoked weed and drank, and weed really gets to him. They literally created a whole commotion, with emergency workers going up to him til he woke up. Giving him some kind of electrolyte drink, etc. And then they left and now they are right next to us with a leftover joint. We light it up and me and Karol have a smoke - which I’ll instantly regret bc whenever i smoke nowadays i get so incredibly high. And that’s what’s happening when we are walking to the next spot. The conversation during this walk had one new little idea. Mike and his conversational oddities, asking - how old do you think this building is? And we’re in the ues, one of the earlier parts of the city that was built up. So each building tended to be around 100 years old. The foundation. Not the renovation. We soon end up at some spot and it’s as one expects. Finance looking young bros everywhere. Everyone is so very different than what I’m used to in Brooklyn. It reminded me of bros and bro-like girls, similar sort of folks to where i grew up. And the weirdest coincidence, a bartender that works at the bar i go to after cover - the gate - was there singing in a band. Walked in right when they were wrapping up. We settled in uncomfortably in this rowdy busy bar. The waitress was this kind of beat up looking woman a bit younger than me that was joking with me, mildly flirting. But my stoned, lost self had no ability, no desire. The conversation was lost and confusing. And, when I’m out of it notice this much more so than i would otherwise. So i go out of the way to talk to Kayla, bc i know with her i at least can have an intentional conversation, even amongst all the insanity around us. I ask her about her show coming up, it’s her first opera since COVID - she’s a trained opera singer. And I ask what the show is. It’s a Mexican opera. About a nun exporting life outside of this life, her sexuality, the strange delusion of religion, etc. And her role, it’s the perfect role, she’s an old lady - the overseer of the nuns. The one scolding and trying to keep this wayward nun in line. And i could not ask for a possible love interest to be given a role I’d feel more connected to. A role that, while i cannot relate to in a clear cut way, it’s still relatable in terms of how i fundamentally see my personality. Blunt, shrewish, pointed - this voice that comes from somewhere ancient. An intuitive soul, with one foot in reality, one foot in some kind of spirit world. We go on until we’re dragged back into the group by the booming voice of karol. We go soon after. The next day I’d hear that mike has covid, who I’d been sharing cigs with the entire night, and he was very sick.

Thursdays main rememberable occurrence was the dynamic btw jack and Miguel. Which was on full display after he both of then were about 3 drinks in. Miguel literally slaps him, repeatedly, as if it’s nothing. The conversation goes as it does for 10, 15 minutes. Then a slap. Not a very hard slap but not a soft one either. An insanely confusing thing to see, and there’s no explanation. The only possible one is that there’s something innate within Miguel. All his weird innate qualities are over and over on display. There’s this and there’s his interaction with Ashley. With Ashley he just puts her down the whole time and she tries to put him down in return, but it seems so natural, so subconscious. Such an odd behaviour. And this slapping behaviour is next level. Can’t imagine how he’d treat a lover that he actually loved.

Thursday was Ghana ppl-

## sometime after

All this writing over the past few years. Is it going to be used for something or is it going to exist without a decision of its purpose. It’s use.

There’s pictures, tons of pictures. But the path to write is one that has a future living in a barely comprehensible reality. One that is incredibly unlikely to lead to a living. And the living, look at it, you sit and write. You have to experience, you have to search for ways to turn what happens in your life into a story - a universal image. There’s this beauty to it but there’s this physical deficiency to it. It requires one to be a hoarder of words. A life in physical movement is going to do what to this body? It’s so hard to connect to it with this physical action. Pen to paper, fingers to screen, fingers to keyboard.

But words always return to a certain resignation. The being acts. And it matters not so much what the act is. What matters is that it does to the furthest extent of its capabilities. Who we are, who we have become - is always the starting point, for every one of us. Equal footing.

It’s so easy to speculate. To think big ideas when you return to a medium. Returning to this mindset of writing on a phone on this app. But this is not writing on equal footing. This is writing as a kind of release of the initial petty, amateur thoughts that roll out of this strange fact that we so frequently think we can be an expert instantly.

But the writing that sticks, that can be felt, understood tends to come from images of our past or pasts we can relate to. A continuation of the storytelling instinct. But writing is so different from the life we live. We are not stories, stories happen to us and around us though we’re required to let the world talk to us, to show us itself in a way that others can empathize with. But more than empathize; they need to feel that what they’re reading can speed up their ability to create stories like the ones you relate in their own life. It directs them, shows them new possibilities and ways of living. In the very least you need them to feel that the vicarious reality you bring to them is something they want deeply.

## and after again

Fuck is this experience. Coming into a place when it’s quiet. And within minutes it turns into madness. I said, I come with a storm. The storm though, was coming without me. Connections, with what? That which happens in this world, but is brought to the world through you - could not without you? It’s hard to know how to feel as the easy thought arises that you are here, in this world - without sense. And all you do is necessary to make what you are amongst. As if to say you are a necessary part! But it is the easy thought. And oh how simple it is to retreat to that which is easy.

Dickens. This is all so dicksonian. There is a beginning and the beginning sets a precedent. A kind of welling of emotion, a climax that has no break - a perpetual orgasm. It’s a recipe. And it’s been proven to work. Tell a man what is true and sound convincing and he won’t know when to stop listening. He won’t. Why stop when what is happening will change you? You’ve decided, what is being said to me is true. I lack truth, dame, rapidly give this to me because I’ve decided to want it. Who’s to say what you think is true is right or wrong? It is absolutely right, it’s been built for you. It is your truth.

We are spending each moment searching for what we are living through means. But answers exist only in what we experience. If there’s no story, if there’s nothing that happens around us that makes us say - this is where I came from, what is there? What has been brought to you is perfection, but what you do with it is perpetually up to you. Will you make your life more connected?

But the question arises, can you connect? It’s a life where we all have our distinct character. This person. This other. This person is for me. This one is not. You, I can love. You, I cannot. And then the contradicting reasoning. This person I’ve known forever. This one I have not. This person is so close to me and I am in complete confusion how to feel for them but I love them. This one is a stranger. We are all in our life situations, and we are all in love with this situation. Don’t think you are not, it is all you know. Correct yourself every second you think you do not love all you know.

You have to realise, every second of your social existence that everything everyone says to you is coming from what they know. And everyone you will ever meet knows so very little. And every thing they ever do and ever say is built upon every thing they have ever done and every saying they have ever manifested.

What one writes is the same exact story. Every thing anyone will ever write is built on what they wrote before. Words within one’s mind, you must realize, only repeat when you consider them evanescent. They are not. They are you and you must manifest them or they will stick to you. It’s not to say thoughts unholy are the truth, it’s that the root of those thoughts have a place that must be reconciled. To find the root is a journey worth undertaking every moment of your existence. As long as you realize the root can never be reached.

You can look into yourself. You can see every single bit of trauma you experienced in your childhood, in your adolescence, in your puberty, as a young adult. And say you are at peace. But your peace is what? It’s a sense that you are content with your being. But this contentment is what? A next step. And you don’t know the next step. There are jumbled thoughts that say this or that is it. And you will act on those thoughts because they’re your truth. The most perfect truth.

If the people you grew up with were racist, you are racist. If you grew up in a community where x ethnographic dominates, you are x ethnographic. If you grew up listening to a bunch of schmucks, you are a schmuck. But the world will love you as long as you realize what you are. As what you are is the perfect truth.

## and after again

I’m not gonna be depressed here with you. There’s no reason you should expect that from me. If that’s how you’re gonna be, don’t expect me to sympathize with you.

She saw me glance her in the eyes, and thought that something was there. Obviously nothing was there. But she was sure. Jealousy.

When the world is so very pointed. It expresses itself in such an aggressive way. What do you do about it? You turn it off. It stops, only to return. And what are you? This person that stops aggression. But is it ever stopped? No, it continues. It’s a game. The aggressive have an agenda.

The purpose is never clear. It’s based on a reality you do not understand. Perhaps, unwilling to understand. But it’s only because this agenda is so particular, so contingent on you saying yes - I fully understand. There’s no in between, only full understanding is allowed. It’s not to say these people have nothing worth saying. It’s so obscurely interesting, all of their words - but they are so difficult to connect to. As everything said is built as so very grand of a castle. It demands genuine feeling. But your words are like cannonballs against a barrier. It’s a battle. You cannot fault one for desiring a battle. How often in life have battles been what concludes?

All of the battles we remember relate to borders. But we’re not borders. Humans may live and solely dwell in countries, which vaguely have borders - but in the social domain, within your community, the borders are not so clear. At least, I hope they are not for you.

In the urban world we live in borders fluent. Borders changeable. In the rural world, which fully exists in the urban world (how many people can we know?) - our battles are hard fought. There are battles… changeable and permanent.

## again

This place always feels so very energetic. On the way walking to the bar - perhaps because of the cold, the excitement of chatting with the girl at the Coworking spot, the memories of this bar - I was anxious and nervous.

And now I’m lost. I don’t know a soul here. It feels useless to be here but I know that I will not leave for a few more hours. I’m waiting for the pool table to feel more free. Less closed off, less close friends owning the table but I don’t have the sense that is to happen anytime soon. So I’m living in a lost confusion. Living as if all that I can do won’t count for much, won’t bring me peace, won’t release my nervousness.

The fact never ends that humanity is idiotic. At the corner a kind of couple, a kind of couple that is exceedingly lost. A couple next to me that is absolutely static. The man looks at his phone, presumably at instagram or the like - browsing and browsing - while the woman sits idly, exuding this depressive comfort. And a man a few seats down who definitely wants to chat. He likely grew up round here, just coming out for a drink, enjoying himself. Every time I look towards him a glare.

And in the back of my head the predominant thought is what is next? What will the next step be? I want pool but the reluctance is more than painful, it’s dumb. But it’s the reality that makes sense.

## again again

Could tell it was gonna happen the moment I said, can I buy a smoke off of you? The smoke, the instant jump to absolute inebriation. The stumbling. The utter loss of physical coordination. One cigarette and I went from nearly sober to drunk. Finishing the beer not done. Not finishing it because I felt decrepit. So I said, can I pay? Even this question was hard to get out. But i did. And I got my stuff, and headed out the door.

A bike ride home. The entire way feeling like an absolute mess. Wondering, will I do something stupid, please don’t do anything stupid. Having thoughts about this, about that - your drunken thoughts sound so good, but the self behind them sees the idiocy. But they go on, and you search for something of value. Lean your thoughts in this direction, in that, will there be a genuine revelation? And it’s hard to say if yes, if no. But they’re there, and they are perfect and so very satisfying while they are happening. The mind thinks they make sense, it knows they do, they are perfect thoughts. They run on and on, build on and on onto theirselves. And you know, after all your previous iterations of this past, they will disappear. They will, if they become anything, be incomprehensible to your future. A part of who you are, the thoughts you have every moment from here on out will be connected to these thoughts. What they will do, you feel utterly sure, will likely do more damage than harm.

And I find myself home. No dinner had been eaten. So food is needed. If I can get anything in this stomach, but nothing wants to go in. Of all things, I open a tin of sardines. Bread. Bread is a good idea. I eat bits of it, ravenously, and wait. Nausea. The nausea has not left for the past… 2 hours. And it will not go away. One sardine. A nibble of bread like a mouse. Water, drink the water. Still nausea. And it’s a cold day. And the living room is a cold room. But I must not, I dare not vomit. Vomiting is a mortal sin for an alcoholic. So I sit there until I think, the couch - it looks awfully comfortable. And I end up there. I’m fetal.

## what now

It has to be a new cosmology. Sun, moon, earth. Built on some strange science. And man. Man’s reality. Man’s way of finding reconciliation with the world it is born into. Different forms of man. Men of feeling, of action, of art, of wealth, of poverty. Archetypes. It would take a tremendous amount of words and planning.

How to organize such a thing? Stories are the most important thing. It must build into itself. Genuine mythology. It has to feel not made up, but true somehow.

Constant movement. One thing then the next thing and on and on must happen. But what would make sense?

A mythology requires a human element. A dark, mysterious place where one thing after the next happens. And the characters are relatable, understandable. There has to be some form of hero, it has to be first person, it’s where my sentiment most closely directs itself. A who struggling slowly through the world.
